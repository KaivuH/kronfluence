<|begin_of_text|>Citizens have 911. Employees have the EEOC. Distressed sailors have the Coast Guard.

But what do America’s college students have? Where can they turn when they find themselves outside campus “safe spaces” and suffering a “microaggression”?

Fortunately, the University of Arizona has an answer. It recently distributed a 20-page booklet suggesting to faculty that when a student is victimized by a microaggression the appropriate response should be saying “ouch.” And the correct response for the offender should be saying “oops,” according to the guide.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

“If a student feels hurt or offended by another student’s comment, the hurt student can say ‘ouch.’ In acknowledgement, the student who made the hurtful comment says “oops.” If necessary, there can be further dialogue about this exchange.”

The guide was authored by Jesus Treviño, vice provost of the big taxpayer-funded university, whose salary reportedly is $214,000 per year.

For those unfamiliar with the apparently epidemic scale of microaggression and thus not able to spot such offenses, the booklet offers a definition: Microaggressions are “the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.”

The University of Arizona isn’t the first to suggest the “ouch”/”oops” protocol. Iowa State University, among others, has also urged a similar approach.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Most Democrats want stricter gun laws, and most Republicans oppose them. So you might expect the election of Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress to be great news for the nation’s gunmakers. But surprisingly, the opposite turned out to be the case.

Two of the nation’s biggest gun manufacturers, Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger, saw their stock prices fall by double digits this morning in the wake of Trump’s election victory.

Here’s one theory for what’s going on: In recent years, gun sales have been driven by fears of gun confiscations. Gun sales soared after Obama’s election in 2008 and again when he was reelected in 2012, as people worried that the president would begin to confiscate the nation’s firearms.

In contrast, gun owners have little to fear from a Trump presidency or a Republican Congress. So gunmakers are likely to make fewer sales over the next four years.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>WOMEN and men face double-standards. That this should show up in the language is no surprise. Men who put themselves forward at work are “assertive”, women who do the same are more often “pushy” or “bossy”; men are “persistent” whereas women are “nagging”; men are “frustrated”, women “upset”. A man has a lot to say; a woman is “chatty”. A man discusses the doings of his colleagues and rivals; a woman “gossips”.

Readers tempted to doubt can check for themselves. For an impressionistic survey, type “gossip” into Google, click on “images” and see who appears to be doing it; then try the same with “nagging” and “bossy”. For hard data, try Google’s “Ngram” viewer, which shows the frequency of words and phrases among the hundreds of billions of words in the books scanned by Google, spanning centuries. One of the most common words following “gossiping” is “old”. And the most common words to follow “gossiping old” are, in this order: “women”, “woman”, “men”, “lady” and “ladies”.

Some words are trickier than mere double-standards: those using them may think they are paying a kind of compliment, whereas what is heard is something between condescension and insult. A case in point is “feisty”. Those who use it might think that the word connotes “spirited”. It is often heard by women, though, as carrying a whiff of surprise that a woman would show such spirit.

“Nonsense”, some will reply. The Economist has used “feisty” recently to refer to Greece’s leftist government, a South African tabloid, a (male) Argentinian presidential candidate and Singaporean opposition bloggers. But it is also used fairly frequently with female figures. The common thread seems to be a sense of smallness or underdog status: nobody calls a jowly dictator or heavyweight boxer “feisty”. Google’s book data say much the same. “Little” is one of the most common words to follow “feisty”, and the most common words to follow “feisty little” are “girl”, “man”, “thing”, “guy”, “woman” and “lady”. Rounding out the top ten words following “feisty little”, intriguingly, are “Irishman” and “bastard

<|begin_of_text|>Utah’s Wasatch GOP has two chairmen. One of them is named James C. Green. Mr. Green has some big ideas and he decided to share one of those big ideas with the public.

Here’s Mr. Green’s caveman missive:

Equal Pay For Women Has Consequences

Editor: Here's the problem with the Equal Pay bill being considered by the Utah Legislature... Traditionally men have earned more than women in the workplace because they are considered the primary breadwinners for families. They need to make enough to support their families and allow the Mother to remain in the home to raise and nurture the children.

If businesses are forced to pay women the same as male earnings, that means they will have to reduce the pay for the men they employ... simple economics. If that happens, then men will have an even more difficult time earning enough to support their families, which will mean more Mothers will be forced to leave the home (where they may prefer to be) to join the workforce to make up the difference.

And as even more women thus enter the workforce that creates more competition for jobs (even men's jobs) and puts further downward pressure on the pay for all jobs... meaning more and more Mothers will be forced into the workforce. And that is bad for families and thus for all of society.

It's a vicious cycle that only gets worse the more equality of pay is forced upon us. It's a situation of well-meaning intentions, but negative unintended consequences.

We should encourage our Legislators to drop the whole notion. Let the marketplace determine what free-market forces should prevail. It is not the role of government to dictate to businesses what they should pay anyway... either as a Minimum Wage or Equal Pay for men and women.

James C. Green

<|begin_of_text|>Gay, bi or straight, people are having same-sex experience in their lifetime.

More American men and women are identifying as bisexual, reports a recent publication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The study, which utilised the data collected from the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), aims to provide ‘national estimates of sexual behaviours, sexual attraction, and sexual orientation among women and men aged 18–44 in the United States.’

Over 9,000 adults’ interview results were used to churn out the end statistics.

The outcome reports that 5.5% of women and 2.0% of men said they are bisexual in the 2011–2013 NSFG, as compared to the previous 2006–2010 NSFG study which found that only 3.9% of women and 1.2% of men identified as bisexual.

And among those who reported themselves as ‘heterosexual or straight,’ 12.6% of women and 2.8% of men said that they had had same-sex sexual contact.

The study also provides other interesting insights about what different couples do in bed:

Women who reported to be ‘homosexual or bisexual’ were more likely to have had anal sex with an opposite-sex partner (44.2%) compared with 35.4% of heterosexual women.

More women in the ‘homosexual or bisexual’ group had ever had opposite-sex sexual contact (89.7%), as compared to men (67.9%).

And surprisingly, or not, 16.4% of women and 11.4% of men who had identified as ‘homosexual or bisexual’ had never had same-sex sexual contact.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>What’s happening to female characters in video games? They’ve been around forever and they’ve seen the changes of growing technology and differing trends, but it never felt like they ever truly lost anything. They simply grew with the stories and games, maybe became a little more numerous as games started including more characters and options. Recently though, they have changed. Not due to the natural evolution of the medium, but seemingly due to this idea rooted in the stereotype that only dudes game, and because only dudes game, the only way we can view female characters is through the eyes of guys. And thus while male characters are perfectly allowed to remain muscle-bound, stoic, and badass, women must be “realistic” because otherwise guys might get the wrong idea.

Now, aside from the fact that this is pretty insulting to the intelligence and motivations of men, it’s a little bizarre for the same people who want more women in the industry and enjoying video games to perpetually only address things from a strictly male perspective. A purely negative perspective at that, assuming only the very worst outlook from male gamers. Never have I seen from the arguments saying female characters need to change any reference to what women want in female characters. Which is a shame, because if we did, those characters wouldn’t change much. Because, objectively, there is enough diversity in how female characters present themselves that I believe most of the women who play are happy with it.

The argument has already been made that men tend to be just as sexy and unrealistic as women when it comes to video games. And the usual rebuttal is “That’s just a male power fantasy.” Consider, maybe, that the sexy but deadly female heroine might be just as much a female power fantasy. Or the not-so-sexy but kind and passionate young girl who always strives to improve the lives of others. Or the badass female space marine fighting for her home. Has it occurred to no one making the argument against sexy characters that women have just as much of a need to fantasize—to become someone who is so unlike them, and yet, seems to hold the same values? Or even to become someone completely different from them just to unwind and forget life for a few hours?

Speaking as a woman, I don’t play games for their realism. I don’t mind if a game embraces a little realism, as long as they’re still clearly rooted in fiction. I am especially partial to fantasy, and whether it’s a character I have made completely from scratch for a pen and paper roleplay, or a character

<|begin_of_text|>The forestry industry is largely inaccessible to women for many reasons; however, Forestry Training for Women will remedy that. Personal Protective Equipment [PPE] is not made in small enough sizes, both foot-wear and clothes to fit many women. Training for using forestry kit, in particular chainsaws, is taught in such a way as to emphasize physical strength when in fact using the “right” technique can get over most issues. If funded, this course will provide an environment to practice these techniques in private with other female participants. Students would learn to service and sharpen saws and hand tools together with all aspects of woodland and forestry skills and work. This would empower students to compete on equal terms in the job market with their male counterparts. Students will also be taught about tree identification, the various uses they serve in the landscape and small sawmill operation.

The photograph above shows the various tools used in forestry and the difference between men and womens sized boots.

Digger driving is another aspect of forestry that is seen as a male dominated job. Lighter women sometimes cannot use digger cabs, levers and pedals effectively. A second component of this course would address the use of a Digger and provide women with the training needed to operate one comfortably. This course will teach women to service and care for their machine, how to operate it and provide a few simple adaptations to overcome the male oriented aspects of the machine. The course will cover and practice the most common requirements such as trench digging and ditching along with a range of different scenarios that might be encountered on a daily level.

There are few opportunities for women to compete and train on an equal level to men. We aim to address this by offering training and real life practice in a safe and all encompassing environment where women would feel comfortable to learn. The funding would allow us to purchase a second hand digger for training purposes, saws and PPE for participants.

It is important to note that instructors will be male and while this course is aimed at women students, male participants are encouraged to join if interested.

<|begin_of_text|>Prostitutes are penis experts. There is no other group of professionals – not scientists, not academic researchers, not journalists – that have more experience viewing and handling a large number and wide variety of penises. Additionally, prostitutes are probably the only professional group qualified to comment on how penises of differing sizes and shapes feel when they are inside a woman.

It seems like every month another article about the latest penis size study is published. It’s a popular media topic because men are becoming increasingly obsessed with the size of their genitals, thanks in part to the wide availability of online porn showing women writhing in pleasure as they receive a plunging from one large penis after another.

There is a lot of speculation about what the perfect penis is supposed to look like, how long or wide it needs to be in order to deliver pleasure, and what’s considered “ideal.” I decided to share my informed opinion as a licensed Nevada prostitute and write about certain myths that many people tend to believe, either due to lack of sexual experience or a limited exposure to all of the various penis shapes and sizes. Below are what I consider to be the three most common myths about penis size.

Myth #1: There is such a thing as an “ideal” penis size

I’ve seen a lot of cocks. They come in all shapes, lengths, widths, and colors. Some bend upwards, some downwards, some curve to the side. Some are almost the size of my forearm, some the size of my thumb. I’ve seen penises with a sharp bend like a water faucet, and penises shaped like a mushroom, with a large head on a smaller shaft. While some online resources will try to trick people into believing that there is such a thing as an “ideal penis,” I’m here to tell you that as long as your penis is healthy, it’s ideal for sex and is capable of pleasing a woman.

There are so many ways that one healthy penis can differ from the next, that it’s pointless to try to figure out what’s “normal” or “ideal.” Sure, you can go on Wikipedia, read that the average penis length is 5.17 inches, get an idea as to how you measure up against this average, and feel better (or worse) about yourself. But comparing yourself to a statistical average or striving for an ideal will not only give you a false perception of the wonderful diversity of healthy penises, but also impair your ability to see yourself as a valuable individual who uses your unique body to be the best

<|begin_of_text|>The issue is particularly nettlesome with individuals who have transitioned from male to female because of the belief that they might still have a physical advantage until their hormone therapy — which not every transgender person chooses to have — is complete.

“When you start talking about transgender athletes, a male-to-female individual, we want to ensure that that is truly a decision that is permanent,” said Bobby Cox, the commissioner of the Indiana High School Athletic Association. “It is not a decision that, ‘I just decided today that I am going to be a girl and I am going to go play on a girls’ team’ and perhaps, disadvantage those kids that are on the team and imbalance the competition.

“And as we progress down this path,’’ he added, “and as we spend more time and energy with advocacy groups and medical professionals in this area, I think that there will be additional amendments to our policies.”

There is no reliable data on the number of transgender high school athletes. Only about 0.6 percent of the adult population identifies as transgender, according to federal data from 2016. Researchers from the Williams Institute, who conducted the study, reported that 0.56 percent of adults in Indiana reported identifying as transgender.

In Texas, 0.66 percent of adults said they identify as transgender, the fifth-highest percentage in the country (behind Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Georgia). Still, transgender children are considered an at-risk minority outside of sports. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the rate of suicide attempts among transgender people is 40 percent, compared to 4.6 percent among those who are not transgender.

Relatively new policies are already being massaged and amended. In July, the Indiana state association voted unanimously to adjust its surgery requirement. It now no longer requires transgender students who are transitioning from female to male to have sex reassignment surgery in order to compete in the gender with which they identify. But that stipulation is still in place for someone transitioning from male to female.

The group asserts it is acting in the name of fairness, but transgender rights activists accuse members of simply not wanting transgender people to participate, out of fear that those athletes will have an unfair advantage.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>A connection between lesbian lust and identifying as male came to me after reading the prologue to Audre Lorde’s Zami : A New Spelling of My Name (full text here.) Lorde describes wanting to be both male and female and she fantasized about having a penis. It’s increasingly common for lesbians to think they are men so I think this needs to be discussed. In this post I’m going to describe my interpretation of Lorde’s quote, which was written in 1982, and then discuss the phenomenon of lesbians feeling “male” within the current context of porn culture and transgenderism.

“I have always wanted to be both man and woman, to incorporate the strongest and richest parts of my mother and father within/into me—to share valleys and mountains upon my body the way the earth does in hills and peaks. I would like to enter a woman the way any man can, and to be entered—to leave and to be left—to be hot and hard and soft all at the same time in the cause of our loving. I would like to drive forward and at other times to rest or be driven. When I sit and play in the waters of my bath I love to feel the deep inside parts of me, sliding and folded and tender and deep. Other times I like to fantasize the core of it, my pearl, a protruding part of me, hard and sensitive and vulnerable in a different way. I have felt the age-old triangle of mother father and child, with the “I” at its eternal core, elongate and flatten out into the elegantly strong triad of grandmother mother daughter, with the “I” moving back and forth flowing in either or both directions as needed. Woman forever. My body, a living representation of other life older longer wiser. The mountains and valleys, trees, rocks. Sand and flowers and water and stone. Made in earth.”-Audre Lorde

This quote is rather poetic and I have allowed myself to see lots of things in it that I don’t know if Lorde actually intended. These are some things I see when I look at these words.

Lorde has described wanting the best qualities of her mother and father and wanting to be both hard and soft during sex. When I read this I thought about how people are expected to limit their self-expression and interests to what society believes is appropriate for their sex, and Lorde is refusing to limit herself that way. She wants the full human experience, not just a half of it. Gender roles and

Mycorrhizal fungi are more like cities than individual plants; these are complex systems which stretch for miles underground in search for nutrients.

So massive and impactful are they, Nasa has now been able to identify them from space.

Researchers say it could finding and studying these networks could help them predict how climate change will affect forest ecosystems. "Individual tree species have unique spectral fingerprints," said Joshua Fisher, lead author of the study. "But we thought the underlying fungi could be controlling them as groups."

Two types of the fungi control different sets of trees, with each type responding differently to climate change. Knowing where each type is dominant "may help us predict where forests will thrive in the future and where they'll falter", the team says.

Ceating fungi maps to chart this growth has proved difficult, as it has traditionally depended on "counting individual tree species". So the team decided to detect the network via satellite.

Using the "spectral signature" of the trees -- that is, the pattern that the tree's canopies reflect -- the satellite can differentiate between the trees. Four forests were analysed during the project -- around 130,000 trees and 77 species -- by Nasa's Landsat-5 satellite. The images were then analysed using a statistical model that was able to predict where the different types of fungus were most prevalent. This model, the team say, had around 77 percent accuracy. "That these below-ground agents manifest themselves in changes in the forest canopies is significant," said Fisher. "This allows, for the first time, some light to be shed on their hidden processes."<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Men and women make moral decisions differently, according to new research published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin — but not necessarily in the ways scientists thought before.

The study, a meta-analysis of 40 studies with 6,100 total participants, revealed a more nuanced distinction between two common schools of moral thought.

Deontology vs. Utilitarianism

“Consider…a dilemma where you are hiding with other townsfolk from murderous soldiers,” says Rebecca Friesdorf, the corresponding author. “Suddenly a baby starts to cry—unless you smother it, the soldiers will find and kill everyone. Should you smother the baby to prevent the soldiers from killing the townsfolk?”

According to deontology, killing the baby would be wrong because murder is wrong, despite the potential consequences. Deontology puts moral norms at top priority.

According to utilitarianism, killing the baby is acceptable because it will save many lives in the end. Utilitarianism considers the overall consequences more important.

Deontology has long been associated with emotional responses to moral dilemmas, while utilitarianism is associated with cognitive, or mental, responses. Previous research has claimed that the two are opposites, and that women make more deontological decisions while men make more utilitarian decisions. However, the current study suggests it’s not so simple.

The Study

The research team, comprised of scientists from three universities in three different countries, believes that deontology and utilitarianism are not necessarily opposites—either thought process could be affected by a number of factors. In order to examine them independently, the team used a method called Process Dissociation (PD) to separate the variables. PD has been used previously to separate other controversial variables, such as racial bias in weapon identification.

“To…distinguish whether men are more utilitarian than women, or women are more deontological than men, it is necessary to measure [these]inclinations independently,” said Friesdorf.

The Results

The findings from the study challenge the traditional theory that men prefer cognitive decisions and women prefer emotional ones. After separating the variables, researchers discovered that men and women use cognitive reasoning about equally. However, women were much more likely to use emotional reasoning than men when one factor is involved: harm.

When asked a moral dilemma question that did not involve harm, women and men both tended to use utilitarian (or cognitive) thinking. However, when asked a moral dilemma question involving harm, women were significantly more likely to use deontological (emotional) thinking than men.

<|begin_of_text|>Government is a big insurance company. Except you can’t shop elsewhere for insurance. And their price is super high. And they threaten you if you don’t want to pay them. And the services they deliver are sub-par for the price. And you can’t itemize your “insurance” to only include the products you need. And often just when you need them most, you find out how incompetent, corrupt, and overall ineffective they are at ensuring you against anything.

Just look at Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Governments play politics with awarding repair projects, while the majority of the island is still left without power. Daddy Yankee was a bigger help than FEMA.

And because the government really doesn’t deliver on their promise of keeping people safe and coming to their aid, people still turn to private companies. People still find it in their best interest to use some of the 50% of their income left after the government plunders the rest to purchase insurance.

You pay property taxes, and these go to support indoctrination centers also known as public schools. They pay for local roads, local traffic enforcers, and firefighters. But these services are collectivized. The firefighters aren’t really there to save your home, they are there to keep the whole town from burning down.

Firefighters are likely some of the most dedicated public employees. The ones I have met often go into the profession for the right reasons, and take seriously their commitment to saving lives. Many are even volunteers. But still, they can only show up after they have been called. Many bravely rescue people from serious situations. But rarely is a structure saved.

That is where private insurance comes in. You purchase private home insurance so that in the event that your home burns down, you don’t lose all the money that has gone into it. But some companies go above and beyond when you purchase insurance from them.

Increasingly, insurance carriers are finding wildfires, such as those in California, are an opportunity to provide protection beyond what most people get through publicly funded fire fighting. Some insurers say they typically get new customers when homeowners see the special treatment received by neighbors during big fires. “The enrollment has taken off dramatically over the years as people have seen us save homes,” Paul Krump, a senior executive at Chubb, said of the insurer’s Wildfire Defense Services. “It’s absolutely growing leaps and bounds.”

Chubb provides extra protection to the homes they insure in certain zip codes that are prone to wildfires. They get private firefighters on the scene before the building

That was a question recently posed in two articles (article 1 and article 2), which commented on the global trend of young adult males who are retreating into porn, video games, and lad culture. These articles resonated with so many readers that they garnered over 500 comments from men. People even took to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to share in the conversation. While there was much talk about the problem, there was little talk about the solution, which bothered me as a mother of three daughters who is concerned about their prospects for relating to the opposite sex, as they grow older. So, I’d like to share some advice in an attempt towards bringing healing and unity between the sexes.

Stalemate: The Current State of Affairs in the War Of The Sexes

Popular culture tells us that the cause of the war between the sexes is patriarchal and misogynistic men. As a result, we now have women engaging in lesbianized third-wave feminism. In this most recent wave, we have women who throw tampons and condoms at government buildings or show up angry and bare-breasted in order to protest for the right to kill their own children. As ridiculous as that sounds, it’s just one example of what they’re doing, and it is why many women like myself want NOTHING to do with the feminist movement. We don’t identify with the victim mentality. We don’t believe that our own empowerment will be found and maintained by disempowering men or our own children.

Although there are many women who believe like me, many college age students today are getting lessons on feminism or are being required to take mandatory consent classes for dating. Some say that college age men today are completely clueless or scared about how to engage with women. There is a fear of being accused of rape, along with a fear of court and educational systems that seemingly give women preferential treatment.

"I'm an athlete. My parents have a lot of money. I have plenty of friends and a good social life. I don't hang out with women any more. Occasionally I'll have one night stands, but mostly I fill my time with other things. I got accused of molesting a girl at college and since then I've just thought, whatever. I play sports instead." ~ Francis, 28

An inside look at Hoa Lo Prison, which American POWs nicknamed “Hanoi Hilton” in the 1960s

He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed, and was dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward on to the camp Commandant ‘s feet, which sent that officer berserk.

In 1978, the Air Force Colonel still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying career) from the Commandant’s frenzied application of a wooden baton.

From 1963-65, Col. Larry Carrigan was in the 47FW/DO (F-4E’s). He spent 6 years in the ‘ Hanoi Hilton’…the first three of which his family only knew he was ‘missing in action’. His wife lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned-up, fed and clothed routine in preparation for a ‘peace delegation’ visit.

They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that they were alive and still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his Social Security Number on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man’s hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: ‘Aren’t you sorry you bombed babies?’ and ‘Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?’ Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper.

She took them all without missing a beat.. At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge and handed him all the little pieces of paper…

Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Colonel Carrigan was almost number four but he survived, which is the only reason we know of her actions that day.

Kaskan and Ho looked at how pervasive small subtle biases and stereotyping of American female athletes are and what types of "microaggression" exist, examining how they put pressure on athletes and other women, as well. They reviewed popular Internet articles and research from the Psychinfo database, using keywords such as'sexism,''sports media,' 'Serena Williams' and 'Olympic coverage.'

They conclude that media often portray female athletes as inferior to their male counterparts and are dismissive of their true abilities. The little coverage received often sexually objectifies female athletes by putting the spotlight on their looks and strength. On the other hand, the media is quick to recoil at women who do not fit into the traditional feminine mold.

Is that an accurate characterization? Russian tennis star Anna Kournikova certainly got far more attention than her athletic prowess deserved, but so has Michael Sam. He is somehow among GQ's 2014 “Men of the Year” despite the fact that he was barely drafted by an NFL team, and the only is because hs is gay. A journal devoted to promoting the perspectives of heterosexual men could argue that the media was giving him special attention due to that.

Outside culture studies and sociology, there is no credible acceptance of gender-based microaggressions so the authors invoke racial discrimination. Kaskan and Ho argue that subtle biases that place cumulative stress on female athletes influence how they think about themselves and their abilities.

Yes, Ronda Rousey must not know she can obliterate 99.9% of men just by glaring at them due to subtle microaggression on ESPN. In real life, she absolutely does know that, and she is arguably the most famous name in mixed martial arts - the most male of male sports - yet she knows she can look like this any time she wants too:

That's not a problem for athletic women, it's a gigantic victory.

Regardless, the authors believe that prolonged psychological stress can even trigger changes in their hormonal, immune and cardiovascular systems, and make athletes vulnerable to, among others, heart disease and hypertension. This, in turn, can influence a professional athlete's livelihood when she loses her place in

<|begin_of_text|>Avoiding the male hierarchy is a major part of men’s rights activism and zeta-male culture. And for a good reason I might add. This hierarchy is what causes division and conflict between men, by encouraging them to compete for status, while objectifying them on the basis of their utility to women. Yet, are there other even deeper reasons for us to opt out?

This can be answered by comparing the male social hierarchy to the hierarchy of the Indian caste system. The Brahmans (or the priest class) created the caste system in which they placed themselves at the top. Then, secondly, the soldier-ruler (Kshatriyas) caste, third the farmer, craftsman, merchant (Vaisyas) caste, and fourth the labourer or slave (Sudra) caste.

Under the caste system, the Brahmans lived a life of privilege. They were prohibited from manual labour and have the belief that they are inherently of greater moral purity than members of other castes. They alone had control over certain vital religious tasks giving them great power.

Although they were the highest caste, they did not normally hold official political positions (kings and rulers were all of the Kshatriya caste) yet due to their prestige and religious power, Brahmans had great influence over secular affairs from behind the scenes.

At the other end of the spectrum, Sudras were denied the privileges of the higher castes. Because of the degrading work and pitiable occupations to which they were assigned, such as cleaning waste and disposing of contaminated dead animals.

They were considered unclean and not fit to touch or come in contact with anyone of a higher caste, in fact, the untouchable was required to cross the street or get off the road entirely when the occasion demanded so that his shadow would not fall on anyone of the Brahman caste and in fear of contamination.

Women, like Brahmans, also live a life of relative privilege in comparison to men. They have been socialized from an early age to believe that as women they are morally superior to men.

The Brahmans cleverly kept this order by teaching the castes below them that observance of the rules and restrictions of caste without violation constituted the highest religious fulfilment and would make possible being born again into a better life. Thus the duties and obligations of caste were stressed rather than human rights, and through this system Hindu society was kept stable for over three thousand years.

How does this relate to the male hierarchy? I will explain how by

You’ve always assumed the calico cat that sits in your neighbor’s window is a she. And you’re certain that the orange tabby you’ve fallen in love with at the shelter is a boy. Chances are, you’re right. Most orange cats are male and most calicos are female.

The color of a cat’s coat is closely linked to its gender. As you may recall from high school biology, mammals have two chromosomes that determine their sex—XX for females and XY for males. But a number of additional chromosomes are present and vary depending upon species, says Dr. Robert Grahn, a forensic analyst at the veterinary genetics laboratory at the University of California in Davis.

“These other chromosomes contain genes that affect hair color, pattern, shape and length,” Grahn says. “Since the genes for sex and hair colors are on different chromosomes, they are inherited independently of each other. Thus, no color is associated with a particular sex, except in cats and hamsters.”

Nature doesn’t always abide by a rigid set of rules, however, including when it comes to feline fur color. A small percentage of orange cats are female, and even a more miniscule portion of calico cats are male.

Below, learn how genetics and sex influences a cat’s coat color, and why some cats don’t fit typical color patterns.

Color in Cats is (Mostly) Linked to Sex

Whether calico, tortoiseshell, orange, black, brown, or gray, a cat’s fur color is derived from two dominant colors: Black and red. These colors can mutate into different shades—black can become chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, blue and fawn. And red, which is determined by the orange gene, can become cream.

The color genes for black and red in cats are contained within the X chromosome. This is the same chromosome that, along with Y in males, determine a cat’s sex, says Dr. Jerold Bell, adjunct professor of genetics at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in North Grafton, Massachusetts.

“They are actually alleles, meaning they are two variations of the same gene in one location on the chromosome,” he says. So an X chromosome can contain either a black hair gene or an orange hair gene, but not both.

“One allele will create orange coloration. This allele will cover up all other colors, except pure white. The other allele will create a non-orange coloration. This allele is ‘recessive’ and allows for

This year, the private liberal arts college on the Iowa prairie has added a gender-neutral locker room to its mix of gender-neutral options. It's the most recent step for the school, which became the state's only college to offer a gender-neutral dorm option three years ago as part of a growing trend nationwide.

In what the National Student Genderblind Campaign calls a "rapidly growing collegiate movement," at least 54 colleges and universities across the country, many of them private, provide gender-neutral housing options this year.

"Each year we hear about more campuses adding that as an option," said James Baumann, spokesman for the Association of College and University Housing Officers — International. "I think the changes are a reflection of changing times."

It was such a big deal when Ohio's Oberlin College added co-ed halls in the 1970s that it made the cover of Life magazine. Then, mixed-gender floors became common, Baumann says.

"It's usually a campus responding to a need," Baumann said. "If the student body either overtly expresses a desire for this, or if the housing staff perceives a need for it, that's when they pursue this as an option."

Starting next fall, Catholic University in Washington will move in the other direction, back to single-sex dorms. John Garvey, the university's president, said separating the genders will cut down on binge drinking and casual sex, two forces that are destructive for college students.

Garvey said his institution wants to teach students about virtue, and he sees only ill coming from other colleges' moves toward mixed-gender housing.

"I think it's a bad idea," Garvey said. "I think it's naive to imagine that we're doing a good thing shoving college students together."

At Grinnell, the gender-neutral idea was driven by transgender students, those who don't identify themselves as either male or female, and students transitioning from one gender to the other, students and school officials said.

"It's about creating a safe and welcoming space. It's not about being able to room with your significant other," said Lily Cross, a senior who helped persuade Grinnell officials to offer gender-neutral housing.

Gender-neutral grew from 1% of the school's on-campus housing in 2008-

No, old people vote shortsightedly, choosing the least progressive outcome. In surveys in the U.S. and the U.K., people over 65 — compared with people under 30 — were nearly twice as likely to be against gay marriage; twice as likely to be pro-Brexit; half as likely to support legalization of marijuana; nearly five times less likely to want to spend money on education; 60% more likely to vote for Donald Trump; and nearly 50% more likely to say immigrants have a negative impact on society, despite the fact that they are being wheeled around by them. Whether these figures are accurate is irrelevant, since old people are so bad at Googling.

Their poor choices were always a problem, but it's become far more acute now that there are so many of them. The over-65 generation does not accurately represent our country, because they are overwhelmingly white and actually vote. So, unfortunately, we're going to have to bar them from voting.

When I ran this idea by my 76-year-old father, he partly agreed. "If a 90-year-old has what you can define as dementia, you can test for it," he said. I explained that I was thinking more of 76. I also explained that the problem wasn't that seniors forget things as much as they remember the world of 60 years ago and want to reproduce it. But one challenge of arguing with older people is that because of all the cable-news watching and Founding Father — book reading, they know more. My dad mentioned stare decisis, using Edmund Burke's argument that society is so complex that radical change often has horrible unintended negative consequences such as Napoleon, communism and that horrible rap music.

He also argued that experts are often wrong: In 1980, pundits thought a movie star shouldn't be President; during the Great Recession, economists were sure the Fed's expansionary monetary policy would lead to inflation.

The prognosis is poor: by 2030, 58 per cent of Irish men are expected to be obese, topping the scale of all European countries, according to a UK-based study published last year. If you add the projected number of overweight men to the Irish total, the figure is even worse, coming in at a gut-busting 90 per cent.

Now a new review of men’s food behaviour by Safefood, the all-Ireland health body, shows that we’re well on our way to fulfilling that frightening prediction. It points out that 70 per cent of men in the Republic are currently overweight or obese, compared with 50 per cent of women, as are 69 per cent of men in the North, against 57 per cent of women.

The big question, of course, is why. What is it about living on this island that makes Irish men, in particular, stuff themselves silly, with so little regard for the health consequences?

Many reasons – from simple greed or laziness, to more complex speculations about how men respond to stress, or marriage, or whether they are especially sensitive to the effects of chemicals such as phthalates, commonly found in household products – have been forwarded for male weight gain.

Dr Aileen McGloin, from Safefood, has a list of contributing factors as long as your arm, all of which, it seems, can be summed up by one single sentence. “Men,” she says, “live in a different food world.”

A different food world? Hang on, don’t we all occupy the same universe of choices, populated by temptations like fat-laden ready-meals and sneaky snacks under the desk at work? But McGloin says that men’s experience of eating, and all that goes with it – the shopping, the preparation, the amount they actually consume – is often markedly different to how women encounter their food.

Men are more likely to eat larger portions, they’re less likely to be aware of healthy eating guidelines, and many don’t regard eating well as an important factor in their long-term health.

Is it just about complacency then? Even ignorance? McGloin isn’t keen to be so judgmental. Rather, she says, it’s a matter of cultural conditioning, right from the start.

“You have to be careful about over-generalising, but men are less likely to learn about food in childhood, so they sometimes come into adulthood without

You may recall not long ago Trump reversed Obama’s decision which forced states to allow trannies into certain bathrooms. Our current President didn’t outlaw those transgender bathroom privileges, but simply restored the states’ power to discern for themselves. Therein lies the outrage.

Apple and other companies have decided to take a stand… By getting involved in a lawsuit filed by a trans student suing his school for boys’ bathroom privileges.

Something to note here? People were uncomfortable sharing the restroom with Gavin Grimm, the girl-boy, so the school provided a unisex restroom to him in an attempt to make everyone happy. The boys wouldn’t have to bare themselves before a lady-man, and the trans student wouldn’t have to share a restroom with girls. But it wasn’t enough for the amorphous slug. Of course.

Now he’s demanding access to the boys’ rooms via lawsuit. Entitled little toad. This is the case that Apple and friends are jumping in to support…

A number of leading tech firms plan to file a brief in favor of transgender rights in a case due to be heard next month in the Supreme Court. Apple has been among those leading the charge on the effort, along with… Affirm, Box, Ebay, GitHub, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce, Slack, Tumblr, Yelp. Apple has already spoken out on the Trump Administration’s move to pull back on Obama-era guidance that interpreted existing law to require schools to let students use the restroom that matches their gender identity. The Supreme Court case, involving Virginia high school student Gavin Grimm, asks the court to weigh in on the same question.

These companies really, really care about rights. Just not the rights of the states. Or those who want to potty in peace. It seems as though Apple misses not a single opportunity to get hyper-political (see Apple Goes Full PC, Replaces ‘Offensive’ Gun Emoji With Squirt Gun… and Far-Left Apple CEO to Wage War on Fake News.

Four years ago, Republicans had a smashing campaign season, seizing control of the House and piling up victories in Senate and gubernatorial races from sea to shining sea. Some of those swept into office were buoyed by the tea party-fueled wave.

Four years later, many governors now have to defend their seats under less favorable conditions.

That, succinctly, explains the dynamic in this year’s gubernatorial contests, which is more broadly discussed in this article focused on Republican Gov. Sam Brownback’s struggle in deeply red Kansas.

Of the 36 governors races on the ballot this November, 22 are for seats held by Republicans and 14 by Democrats, numbers that work in the Democrats’ favor in contrast to their struggle in House and Senate races.

Here are some gubernatorial contests to watch, based on interviews with nonpartisan analysts Jennifer E. Duffy of the Cook Political Report and Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg Political Report, as well as campaign strategists for the two major parties.

REPUBLICAN SEATS THAT DEMOCRATS COULD FLIP:

Florida: Gov. Rick Scott barely won election in 2010 and voters haven't seemed to warm to the former healthcare executive. Perhaps the best thing Scott has going for him is his opponent, Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, whose partisan perambulations left him with plenty of critics on all sides.

Kansas: Brownback has pursued an aggressively conservative agenda, highlighted by a record cut in the state’s income tax, which has sent revenues plunging and many moderate Republicans running into the arms of his Democratic opponent, House Minority Leader Paul Davis. Brownback is trying to tie Davis to President Obama, who is overwhelmingly unpopular in the state despite his family roots. (Obama’s mother was a Kansan.)

Georgia: Gov. Nathan Deal has been dogged by an ethics scandal and his bungled response to a freak January snowstorm, among other missteps. The Democratic candidate is Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, who has been a strong fundraiser and may also benefit from heavy Democratic spending on behalf of U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, who offers the party a rare pickup opportunity against businessman David Perdue.

During her interview with Billboard, which has crowned her Woman of the Year, the pop star compared her despair regarding the results – particularly the significant number of women who voted for Trump – to mourning.

“I feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, ‘Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,’ and it wasn’t a bad dream that I had. It feels like women betrayed us. The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high,” she says.

When asked why she thought so many women – according to CNN 53% of white women voted for Trump – Madonna replied:

Women hate women. That’s what I think it is. Women’s nature is not to support other women. It’s really sad. Men protect each other, and women protect their men and children. Women turn inward and men are more external. A lot of it has do with jealousy and some sort of tribal inability to accept that one of their kind could lead a nation. Other people just didn’t bother to vote because they didn’t like either candidate, or they didn’t think Trump had a chance in the world. They took their hands off the wheel and then the car crashed.

Jocks are typically portrayed as dumb. Movies and television shows have shown us that they detest school, pouring every last bit of their precious little brain capacity into jumpshots and touchdowns. There are plenty of jokes to be made about athletes who take seven years to get their bachelor’s degrees.

“Hey, a lot of people go to college for seven years,” says Chris Farley’s character in the ‘90s hit comedy Tommy Boy.

“I know,” replies David Spade’s Richard. “They’re called doctors.”

Charlotte Hornets forward Marvin Williams is not a doctor. He’s a jock, and he always has been. In 2004, the 18-year-old was a five-star high school recruit ranked 11th in the country. He was named to Washington’s All-State team and found himself on several All-American rosters, including the most prestigious one organized by McDonald’s. Naturally, he found his way to UNC, where in his first year he teamed up with studs like Raymond Felton, Rashad McCants and Sean May en route to the 2005 NCAA National Championship.

That summer, after only one season playing college ball, Williams was made the No. 2 overall selection in the 2005 NBA Draft. Being drafted that high meant that the 19-year-old would bank around $10.5 million by the time the rest of his fellow UNC freshmen graduated college three years later. Most people that age would take eight figures’ worth of salary and kiss college goodbye forever.

Williams did not. He continued to pursue his degree.

“It took me 10 summers,” Williams told Basketball Insiders. “I only had one year of academics under my belt when I left Chapel Hill [in 2005], so it literally took me 10 summers to finish.”

In other words, Williams started his summer courses in 2005 after declaring for the NBA Draft, was then the second overall selection in late June, and went ahead and finished up his coursework before beginning his rookie campaign in Atlanta.

“I didn’t waste any time,” he chuckled, remembering that hectic time in his life. “I know myself well enough to know that if I would have stepped away for just even a semester, it would have been more difficult to go back. So I just hung straight in there and kept going.”

For the next nine years after that first one, he took zero breaks. Not for vacation, not for rest. Every summer he’d go back to Chapel Hill, knock out a

<|begin_of_text|>Give tropical forests back to the people who live in them – and the trees will soak up your carbon for you. Above all, keep the forests out of the hands of government. So concludes a study that has tracked the fate of 80 forests worldwide over 15 years.

Most tropical forests – from Himalayan hill forests to the Madagascan jungle – are controlled by local and national governments. Forest communities own and manage little more than a tenth. They have a reputation for trashing their trees – cutting them for timber or burning them to clear land for farming. In reality the opposite is true, according to Ashwini Chhatre of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Hand it over

In the first study of its kind, Chhatre and Arun Agrawal of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor compared forest ownership with data on carbon sequestration, which is estimated from the size and number of trees in a forest. Hectare-for-hectare, they found that tropical forest under local management stored more carbon than government-owned forests. There are exceptions, says Chhatre, “but our findings show that we can increase carbon sequestration simply by transferring ownership of forests from governments to communities”.

One reason may be that locals protect forests best if they own them, because they have a long-term interest in ensuring the forests’ survival. While governments, whatever their intentions, usually license destructive logging, or preside over a free-for-all in which everyone grabs what they can because nobody believes the forest will last.

The authors suggest that locals would also make a better job of managing common pastures, coastal fisheries and water supplies. They argue that their findings contradict a long-standing environmental idea, called the “tragedy of the commons”, which says that natural resources left to communal control get trashed. In fact, says Agrawal, “communities are perfectly capable of managing their resources sustainably”.

Flawed plans

The research calls into question UN plans to pay governments to protect forests. The climate change meeting in Copenhagen in December is likely to agree on a formula for a programme called Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation. “There is a real fear that REDD will lead to dispossession of local communities [as] governments stake their claim on emissions reduction credits,” says Chhatre.

Simon Counsell of the Rainforest Foundation UK is not surprised by the findings. “In Brazil and elsewhere, we know the most enduring forests are in indigenous reserves,

One summer morning in 2006, Jean-Louis Courjault found two dead babies in his freezer. The 40-year-old was trying to find space for some mackerel when he opened a drawer and saw something unusual wrapped in a towel. “I open it,” he later recounted in court. “I see a hand.” In the next drawer there was a second bundle: “I open it and I see that it is also a baby.”

Courjault retreated to the living room in shock. He and his family had moved from France to Seoul, the South Korean capital, four years earlier. As an engineer, Courjault was often away for months on business while his wife, Veronique, 38, looked after their two sons and volunteered at a local kindergarten. That summer, Veronique had taken the boys to France, and Jean-Louis was left alone. “I have to call the police but I do not know their number,” he later remembered. “I can barely say my address, I do not know how to say baby, I do not know how to say freezer.” Jean-Louis phoned a Korean colleague who contacted the police.

The case was shocking, but what followed made it a national sensation in France. DNA tests found that the dead infants belonged to the Courjaults. Jean-Louis and Veronique held hands during a press conference and denied all responsibility, but after further tests confirmed the results the couple was arrested, and Veronique confessed. She had concealed both pregnancies from her husband. Each time she had labored alone in a bathroom and then suffocated the child before hiding it in the freezer. A third baby had been born, she added, while the couple was still in France in 1999—Veronique burned the body in the fireplace. The “affaire des bébés congelés,” or “freezer babies affair,” gripped France for months.

<|begin_of_text|>This list has been expanded into the new book, "Wired to Create: Unravelling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind," by Carolyn Gregoire and Scott Barry Kaufman.

Creativity works in mysterious and often paradoxical ways. Creative thinking is a stable, defining characteristic in some personalities, but it may also change based on situation and context. Inspiration and ideas often arise seemingly out of nowhere and then fail to show up when we most need them, and creative thinking requires complex cognition yet is completely distinct from the thinking process.

Neuroscience paints a complicated picture of creativity. As scientists now understand it, creativity is far more complex than the right-left brain distinction would have us think (the theory being that left brain = rational and analytical, right brain = creative and emotional). In fact, creativity is thought to involve a number of cognitive processes, neural pathways and emotions, and we still don't have the full picture of how the imaginative mind works.

And psychologically speaking, creative personality types are difficult to pin down, largely because they're complex, paradoxical and tend to avoid habit or routine. And it's not just a stereotype of the "tortured artist" -- artists really may be more complicated people. Research has suggested that creativity involves the coming together of a multitude of traits, behaviors and social influences in a single person.

"It's actually hard for creative people to know themselves because the creative self is more complex than the non-creative self," Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist at New York University who has spent years researching creativity, told The Huffington Post. "The things that stand out the most are the paradoxes of the creative self... Imaginative people have messier minds."

While there's no "typical" creative type, there are some tell-tale characteristics and behaviors of highly creative people. Here are 18 things they do differently.

They daydream.

Creative types know, despite what their third-grade teachers may have said, that daydreaming is anything but a waste of time.

According to Kaufman and psychologist Rebecca L. McMillan, who co-authored a paper titled "Ode To Positive Constructive Daydreaming," mind-wandering can aid in the process of "creative incubation." And of course, many of us know from experience that our best ideas come seemingly out of the blue when our minds are elsewhere.

Although daydreaming may seem mindless, a 2012 study suggested it could actually involve a highly engaged brain state -- daydreaming can lead to sudden connections and insights

<|begin_of_text|>Church leaders often worry that Sunday morning is the “most segregated day of the week.”

On Sundays, churchgoers gather inside congregations that are remarkably monochromatic. Whites with whites, blacks with blacks, Latinos with Latinos, Koreans with Koreans, and so on.

This phenomenon, however, is more than discomfort with diversity. It is also a search for safety. In the historic black church, for example, worshippers can assert the dignity and worth that a white society denies them. For three hours on Sunday, the need to avoid offending whites doesn’t govern their lives.

As we are learning in Ferguson, Mo., African-Americans feel unsafe — far more than many whites have realized. Young black men, for example, flinch whenever a police car passes — a vulnerability that money, job and education can’t overcome.

Recent violence against women revealed a similar safety problem. Many women flinch whenever a man draws near and feel demeaned on a daily basis by sexist behaviors at work. Abuse stories are common.

People need safe places, and church has provided that safety to many. In church, a young black male can play drums with the choir, serve as an usher, hang out with friends and feel loved and accepted without any need to avoid eye contact with whites.

Years ago, after a horrible time in a congregation, a friend took me to a black church. He wanted me to rediscover safety inside church doors. There, among the marginalized, I was treated with dignity and respect and felt safe inside a church for the first time in years.

I have wondered why female clergy tend to hire female staff, to select female leaders and to emphasize female needs. Was this the “sisterhood” taking over? Turning the tables on patriarchy?

No, I think it’s part of providing a place where women can feel safe. Not just in charge, but actually safe: free to be themselves, not needing to please men or to fear men, free to imagine God as more than patriarch.

A similar search for safety has led gays to seek out gay-affirming congregations where they can be fully themselves. Some churches are entirely oriented to gay constituents.

Young church folks tend to avoid congregations led by the elderly, because they want to avoid the glares and heavy-handed control battles common in older churches.

Because safety matters so much, established congregations have an even larger dilemma than grappling with financial stress and declining numbers. They need to be safe places first.

In too many congregations, people fight over trivialities. They bully

<|begin_of_text|>Giriraj Singh’s remarks about “white-skinned” Sonia Gandhi shocked a lot of people this week. Tasteless though the comment was, it did bring out a prevalent Indian attitude about the colour of one’s skin. Indeed, one thing that baffles me about India is our love for fair skin. Not unlike many African and Asian countries, Indians too obsess about having a lighter skin colour, consider people with lighter skin as more beautiful and, in the worst case, even ascribe a higher status to them. From the multi-million-dollar fairness products industry to the fact that all children in our baby product ads are fair, one no longer needs to debate that Indians love lighter skin. We do, and that might have just been one of those many Indian quirks had it not had harmful effects on our society. Indians are not fair-skinned on an average, and thus millions have a complex about their skin colour.

Women, in particular, bear the worst of it. I remember my darker-toned cousins being told to not drink tea while growing up (because tea makes you black, as per Indian home science, never mind the English never turned dark despite fighting wars for tea), or to study harder because they were dark and hence it would not be easy to marry them off. Apart from judgments about looks, there is something more onerous when it comes to skin colour and Indians. Dark-skinned people get fewer opportunities in India. This is not racism, but is sometimes referred to as colourism or pigmentocracy. Fair-skinned people are more likely to be hired in certain jobs (when was the last time you saw a dark-skinned flight attendant on an Indian airline?).

We must address this. Not merely in lip service or by raising your voice with catchy slogans for Facebook, but by honestly seeing what is the root cause driving all this.

The key reason why this happens is the associations related to colours, and also to people of a particular colour.

First, is it just the intrinsic colours? White. Black. What do these colours signify to you? White is often used in the context of clarity, purity and cleanliness. Black is used to describe the opposite. White is clean, black is dirt. Is some of this carried through when we refer to the same colours in the context of our skin?

Of course, not everything black is seen as unaesthetic. Thick and shiny black hair is associated with youth, health and beauty. Images of dark brown chocolate, associated with deliciousness, can make one’s mouth water

<|begin_of_text|>Robots, too, can be bad drivers. As the world prepares for the coming future of driverless cars, there are bound to be a few accidents. Launched this summer, a trial of PostBus driverless shuttles in Sion, Switzerland was expected to continue through October 2017. Instead, one of the two shuttles hit a parked van earlier this week, sending the whole trial into a screeching halt.

Test operation momentarily stopped in Sion. Because an autonomous shuttle touched the open tailgate of a parked van in Sion on 21 September 2016, PostBus has decided to interrupt the test operation with the Smart Shuttle for the time being. Nobody got hurt. There was a minor property damage. PostBus and the vehicle manufacturers are continuing to analyse the causes of the incident and take the necessary measures.

The problem echoes that of previous driverless car accidents, where sensors were blind to an unusual circumstance. In February, a Google driverless car was ruled at fault in a crash, as it changed into a lane prematurely and collided with a bus that did not see it signaling. When a Tesla car on autopilot crashed and killed its owner in the United States, it sparked a Federal investigation. The Tesla crash, where the car collided with a trailer crossing the road, was likely because the car’s sensors couldn’t tell the white side of a trailer apart from the blank space of the sky, and failed to stop in time.

So it is with the Swiss shuttle. The slow-moving vehicles (traveling no faster than 12 mph) can carry up to 11 passengers and are monitored remotely. The crash, as it was, appears to be minor, the kind of error that would be wholly unsurprising with a student driver, yet stands out thanks to the technology involved.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Recently, wood has stepped in to fill the unnatural void. One of the oldest known materials used to build things, wood is warm, timeless and beautiful. Its durability and unique fingerprint of grain patterns also make this an ideal material to enclose a tech gadget in.

<|begin_of_text|>Women are so fed up with male entitlement that they’ve not only begun coining terms to classify it—“manspreading” or “mansplaining,” for example—but they’ve also started devising social experiments to find out what happens when women stop being polite and start acting like, well, men.

In an unscientific (but revealing) experiment launched on Friday, Tumblr user Claire Boniface announced that whenever she received a compliment from a male stranger online, she’d agree with him rather than simply ignore the comment or accept it with a gracious “thank you.”

Like many other girls and women online, Boniface was sick of getting criticized by strangers who complimented her photos and then expected a conversation in return.

“If a guy messages me I usually don’t reply because most of the time they are complete strangers to me,” 18-year-old Gweneth Bateman, a British teenager who undertook the Tumblr-based social experiment, told BuzzFeed News. “When they don’t get a reply out of me it usually ends up with them calling me ‘rude’ or a ‘bitch.’ ”

So Bateman flipped the table, responding to texts about her “gorgeous eyes” with affirmations such as “Thank you, I know.” As predicted, the men on the other side of the screen failed the experiment miserably, berating her for her confidence and then retracting the compliment altogether. Bateman cites it as an example of the way men are uncomfortable “when women own their own awesomeness.”

In part two of the experiment, posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, Bateman said she received an equally hateful reaction from men even when she politely agreed with them. The experiment has called attention to the way women’s behavior is judged by different standards from men’s. “If you reject a compliment you’re ‘attention seeking’ but if you accept it you’re ‘vain’ so [you] really can’t win either way,” she tweeted Monday.

Bateman and Boniface weren’t the only women who recently went to great lengths to give men a taste of their own privilege. In November of last year, New York–based labor organizer Beth Breslaw decided that rather than intuitively moving out of the way for people in her path, she’d take a more masculine approach and continue walking, with no regard for other pedestrians.

She got the idea from a friend who initiated the experiment after hearing that men were less likely than women to make room for others on a crowded street. The experiment was not only startling

These are moral prescriptions from books authored by Dina Nath Batra, convenor of Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti, that have now become compulsory reading in government schools in Gujarat. On June 30, the state government issued a circular directing more than 42,000 primary and secondary government schools across the state to make a set of nine books by Batra, translated from Hindi to Gujarati, part of the curriculum’s “supplementary literature”.

Batra’s civil suit earlier this year had led to the pulping of American scholar Wendy Doniger’s book on Hinduism. He had also sent a legal notice to another publisher about a book on modern Indian history which led the publisher to begin a review of some of its books, including one on

sexual violence during riots in Ahmedabad.

The circular issued by the Gujarat State School Textbook Board (GSSTB) read, “These books on supplementary literature are aimed at imparting quality education. They will be provided free of cost to all government primary and secondary schools, public libraries and will be also available at GSSTB, Gandhinagar, for individuals interested in these books. These are to be incorporated from this academic session.”

On March 4, Gujarat Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama released the set of nine books — Shikhan nu Bhartiyakaran, Tejomay Bharat, Prernadeep I, II, III and IV, Vidyalaya: Pravitiyon nu Ghar, Shikhsan ma Triveni and Vedic Ganit.

<|begin_of_text|>I’m a female scientist, and I agree with Tim Hunt.

Allie Rubin Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 13, 2015

Nobel Prize winner Sir Tim Hunt recently caused a stir when he argued that male and female scientists should work independently, because women are a distraction to men in the lab. At a conference, he was quoted as saying, “Let me tell you about my trouble with girls… three things happen when they are in the lab… You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticize them, they cry.”

As improbable as it might sound, I am a female scientist, and I agree with Tim Hunt.

First of all, Sir Tim’s comments are based on his personal experiences, and are therefore incontrovertible. Three hundred and fifty years ago, Isaac Newton saw an apple fall and decided that gravity existed. Three weeks ago, Tim Hunt saw a woman cry and decided that all women are unfit to be scientists. Science is based on observations, which are the same thing as universal proof. Even I know that, and I’m just a woman whose brain is filled to capacity with yoga poses and recipes for gluten-free organic soap. Once, I was lured into a trap in the woods because I followed a trail of Sex and the City DVDs for three miles into a covered pit. Do you really think I could do something as complicated as thinking about science?

Second, Tim Hunt is correct in asserting that women are distracting to men in a lab setting, which greatly affects their productivity. Last month, my labmates and I had to burn our female coworker at the stake for witchcraft because we saw her holding an unwrapped tampon. Between building the stake, lighting an adequate fire, and waiting for her to die, we lost an entire day that we could otherwise have spent working. I make every effort to not distract my male colleagues; sometimes I have to work on my astrology charts from home when I’m menstruating or have leprosy, just so I can let the men in my lab focus on doing real science. It’s a small sacrifice I make that keeps morale in the lab way up.

Tim Hunt also mentions that men and women are constantly falling in love with each other within the lab. This is true; I used to identify as homosexual before working with a group of bearded men and a set of phallic pipettes turned me straight. Once that happened, I couldn’t stop falling in love with every man I met. One time I fell

<|begin_of_text|>Lonely individuals may decode social cues well but have difficulty putting such skills to use precisely when they need them--in social situations. In four studies, we examined whether lonely people choke under social pressure by asking participants to complete social sensitivity tasks framed as diagnostic of social skills or nonsocial skills. Across studies, lonely participants performed worse than nonlonely participants on social sensitivity tasks framed as tests of social aptitude, but they performed just as well or better than the nonlonely when the same tasks were framed as tests of academic aptitude. Mediational analyses in Study 3 and misattribution effects in Study 4 indicate that anxiety plays an important role in this choking effect. This research suggests that lonely individuals may not need to acquire social skills to escape loneliness; instead, they must learn to cope with performance anxiety in interpersonal interactions.

<|begin_of_text|>Teaching a trick to a chicken increases beliefs that chickens are intelligent and can feel emotions.

Learning how to train chickens changes student’s attitudes towards them, according to a new study by Susan Hazel Lisel O’Dwyer (both University of Adelaide) and Terry Ryan (Legacy Canine). The chickens were trained to do a specific task (such as pecking on a red but not green circle) in order to get food. Survey responses before and after the class show more positive attitudes after the clicker-training session.

Lead author Susan Hazel told me in an email, “I believe that the main reason for the students’ change in attitudes to chickens was that they realized chickens are smarter than they thought (they learn the colour discrimination tasks very fast) and also when you work with the different chickens you see their personalities.”

“Some chickens are fast and other chickens still learn quickly but just respond more slowly,” said Dr. Hazel. “It wasn’t so much of a surprise that students were more likely to believe that chickens were intelligent, are easy to teach tricks to, and that they have individual personalities. It was more surprising that this carried over to students more likely to believe chickens could experience boredom, happiness, and frustration.”

Some of the differences are quite striking. Before the class, only 7% of students thought it would be easy to teach tricks to a chicken, but after the class this went up to 61%. Beforehand, 49% thought chickens are intelligent, but afterwards 77% agreed. Most of the students thought chickens had individual personalities before the class (84%), but this went up to 95% after. There were some gender differences, including that women gave higher ratings than men for chicken intelligence.

Each year the chickens are named according to a theme. This time it was members of the Royal family, and the brightest chicken was one called Margaret. Students had a clicker attached to the handle of a scoop containing chicken food. When the chicken got something right, the trainer pressed the clicker (making a sound to signal to the chicken they did the right thing) and then let the chicken eat from the scoop.

The practical class lasted for 2 hours and included time training chickens and other activities. Chickens were chosen because they are easy to care for and handle in the class – and they are unforgiving of their trainer’s mistakes. The class used a technique called shaping which involves rewarding closer and closer approximations of a task to reach the final behaviour. Students worked in pairs to practice shaping on

It’s a dance for all occasions, featuring moves such as the “Wraparound Slap-Around.”

If his man moves outside the paint, Harden lets him go. He’s not about to make the hike out to the perimeter. That’s for suckers. His guy doesn’t have the ball, and you can’t score without the ball. That’s just basketball.

Unfortunately, Harden’s dance moves might be holding him back.

Indeed, an elite player with all the offensive skills in the world can still be his team’s worst enemy, especially when things get physical in the playoffs.

The Rockets face off against the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 1 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals on Sunday. Houston won three of four of their games against Portland this season but could be in for trouble if Harden brings his dancing shoes.

Keep an eye out for Harden’s signature wrap-around and his equally futile “Stand and Stare” technique. His opponents know his moves and will be looking to take full advantage in this critical stage.

Don’t be surprised if Harden throws out a shoulder trying to wrap up Damian Lillard.

Forget a civil defamation suit—two members of the Ontario Provincial Police, aided and abetted by the Crown Attorney’s office, have chosen the nuclear option, charging a Kitchener activist with criminal defamation.

(More here. Needless to say, this latest assault on the right to dissent has not received much coverage in the corporate media.)

From the Waterloo Record:

Dan Kellar, 29, was recently charged with two counts of defamatory libel by officers in the OPP anti-rackets squad as he left his Kitchener home on a bicycle. He was also charged with counsel to assault one of the officers. Police allege he published comments likely to injure the reputation of the officers by exposing them to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that were designed to insult the officers. …Kellar says the officers who arrested him are from the same unit that arrested other AW@L members and activists in connection with G20-related allegations. “The cop who arrested me is the one who’s making all the arrests for conspiracy cases,” he said. He said police agents began infiltrating activist groups before the summit. The two undercover officers joined AW@L [Anti-War at Laurier, a campus peace group], but were kicked out in the spring of 2010, before the summit, because activists didn’t feel comfortable around them, he said. …The defamatory libel charges were laid against Kellar after he put out a “community alert” on AW@L’s website, peaceculture.org. Kellar learned one of the officers had been spotted in Toronto, and, “sent out the warning…’suspected infiltrator police agent spotted in Toronto,’” he said. In the posting, he made comments police allege are defamatory.

Here’s the Criminal Code provision, rarely invoked in this country—until now, I guess:

298 (1) A defamatory libel is matter published, without lawful justification or excuse, that is likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that is designed to insult the person of or concerning whom it is published. Mode of expression (2) A defamatory libel may be expressed directly or by insinuation or irony (a) in words legibly marked on any substance; or (b) by any object signifying a defamatory libel otherwise than by words.

How many times have we promised ourselves tomorrow only to find it never arrives? In today’s world, we often put aside our dreams for comfort, our passions for security, and we let our fears take away our power. We choose unfulfilled lives for freedom, thinking that we can always do it differently tomorrow.

People don’t follow their dreams because they are afraid. They are afraid of losing security. They are afraid if they do what they want, they will die. They have become comfortably numb.

What should scare them is that life is short. The reality is if we don’t follow our purpose, our passions, our joys, that’s when the death begins. And the soul’s death is one hundred times worse than the body’s.

The problem is we aren’t guaranteed tomorrow. We are only guaranteed this present moment. And we are telling the Universe who we are by the actions we display in only this moment. That’s it. That’s all we have. That’s who we are.

We also miss some of the most special moments of our lives because we think we will have time for them later. We tell ourselves that we will do the things we enjoy when we retire. We will go fishing, we will travel, create art, we will do so much…..later. But, later never comes. There is always something standing in the way.

So, I want to propose that we change this way of thinking. I want to propose that we encourage and inspire each other. I propose that we start a Twitter campaign now. Let’s take the world by storm. You think you have time, but right now, time has you. Let’s change this.

Write about the things that you are saving until later. Write the name of your favorite beach. You know. The one that’s your screen saver that you promised yourself you would visit later.

Let’s get inspired. Let’s find a way to do them now.

Pak Textbooks are anti-Hindu… anti-Indian…

Pakistani textbook controversy: They think something, tell different and do harrowing.

“Any material considered ‘inflammatory’ or ‘discriminatory’ to religious minorities should be removed from the syllabus as the government should seriously take action on this matter”, say Salman Ali and Saira Ahmed in a co-written piece in Daily Times Pakistan. But all these dramatic write up and govt announcements come at the verge of extinction of Hindus from the Map of Pakistan! Actually, the textbook controversy & reformations etc. in Pakistan are nothing but an eyewash to prove Islam is not so bad.

Upendra Bharti | HENB | New Delhi | Dec 30, 2016:: On August 11, 1947, three days before the announcement of the independence of Pakistan- separated from India as two parts East and West Pakistan, the Father of the Nation Mohammad Ali Jinnah in his speech said, “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed — that has nothing to do with the business of the State. We are starting in the days where there is no discrimination, no distinction between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and another. We are starting with this fundamental principle: that we are all citizens, and equal citizens, of one State.”

Ridiculous. Sowing the seeds of Islamic communalism in the minds of Muslims of Indian subcontinent and through a holy war named- ‘Direct action’, Jinnah materialized the dream of Pakistan which took the lives of millions and uprooted the innocent people from their soil numerously.

When Pakistan was created in 1947, Hindus constituted about 16% of the population of West Pakistan+ (current Pakistan); by 2016 it is about 1.68% – the population has declined by about 90% in about 70 years. This decimation is the outcome of sustained legal and social discrimination ever since the creation of Pakistan. The situation of minority persecution in has not been stopped anyway. The overall situation of synchronized plights on Minority Hindus (mostly Dalit/ Scheduled caste and tribal categories) through physical torture, bonded labour, abduction, ransom, attack

<|begin_of_text|>Geography Is Dynamic. Let’s break this down a bit.

Geography – The study of the physical features, atmosphere, and the human-environmental interaction of the Earth.

Dynamic – Constantly changing.

Geography Is Dynamic. Why? Because geography is about studying the Earth, and the Earth is constantly changing. Nothing on Earth remains in a static position. The only constant on the Earth is change. Things are always changing. The rate of which things change varies from place to place.

Even within the field of geography, there is a subfield of geography that is specifically about the changes in physical geographic features. It is known as geomorphology. See video below to learn more.

Geomorphology is just one example of how geography is dynamic. In fact, if you look at every subfield of geography, from tourism geography, limnology, urban geography, biogeography, environmental geography, to political geography, geomatics, and cartography. Things are always changing on the planet. All the more reason they need to be studied. And this should be the very first rule of geography. Geography Is Dynamic. It is dynamic because this earth is dynamic.

In teaching geography in the schools, this should be the first lesson. Geography is dynamic. Learning state capital should not be the first thing anyone learns when it comes to geography. Understanding that the Earth is dynamic is the first thing that should be learned.

Why learn geography? Because it’s a dynamic subject. Why is it dynamic? Because Earth is a dynamic place. Things are always changing. We need to constantly study those changes.

<|begin_of_text|>Analysis Google, Facebook, and likely other major tech firms are investigating ARM-compatible chips to drive low-power servers, which could ultimately shakeup the types of processors that sit inside data centres.

We were moved to consider the pros and cons of moving away from trusty x86 into the problem-filled world of ARM after a Bloomberg rumor circulated on Thursday that Google was planning to use ARM chips for servers, and after we spotted a smoking gun blogpost by Facebook that indicated it hoped to evaluate ARM systems for production use.

Companies are interested in ARM chips due their historically thrifty power consumption; right from the start, the processor architecture – born from a small team at Acorn Computers in the 1980s – was designed to be RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing). This means ARM cores do lots of simple operations relatively quickly; this simplicity, and the lack of legacy cruft to support, keeps the transistor count low, which means less power is required.

This customisable architecture is wildly popular in the battery-powered gadget and embedded electronics worlds, where processing performance isn't key – anything taxing can be offloaded to dedicated silicon – so the chips can be run slower and thus consume even less power.

Compare this to Intel's CISC (Complex instruction set computing) design, which offers a larger range of operations, has a mountain of legacy tech to support – from 16-bit real mode all the way up to 64-bit protected long mode – and generally runs at higher speeds to give punters the most bang for their bucks. All this adds up to beefier, power guzzling packages.

Though ARM cultists portray RISC as being fundamentally better at low-power computation, academic studies have disproved this [PDF], noting instead that the main differences in power consumption come from historical implementations – ARM has spent nearly two decades living in your pocket, whereas Intel has resided in your honking big desktop, and so on. Indeed, the heart beating in today's x86 chips is RISC in design albeit wrapped in a CISC compatibility blanket.

ARM has for a long time focused on cutting power consumption due to its home markets being mobile and non-performance-demanding devices, whereas Intel previously emphasized speed; chips powered by ARM cores are built from the ground up to sip rather than suck current. The drawback is that they beaver away at a relatively leisurely pace.

I’d always been useless with girls, but now they flock to me. I may as well be a Beatle. One of the good-looking Beatles, too. Not even Ringo. This is unprecedented.

What’s the cause of this sudden attractiveness? Is it my charismatic new thousand-yard stare? Are these vomit stains making my eyes pop? Hardly. It’s him.

I had no idea that people went so crazy for babies. In my pre-fatherhood days, a baby was something to endure through gritted teeth because it was about to ruin your flight. I thought that was universal. But no. Take a baby outside in a sling and well-wishers will swarm around you. I’ve even amassed a small arsenal of stock answers, such has been the barrage of genuine affection for him. A boy. Almost two months. About 10lb. He has his mum’s eyes. No, he’s not normally this quiet. Bright yellow, smells awful, thanks for asking.

Incidentally, this sling has been incredible. Put a baby in a sling and not only will it automatically go to sleep, but you also get to use both your arms again. Last weekend, because motherhood had transformed the back of her head into a nightmarish mishmash between a dreadlock and a rat king, my wife went for a haircut. It was the longest amount of time I’d ever had to spend alone with my son without the safety net of an emergency handover, and it was making me slightly antsy.

However, once I’d put him in a sling, I could do anything. I was able to wash up, bake a cake, wash up again and complete the really hard Assassin’s Creed side-mission where you have to rescue the prostitutes, all by the time she came back. This newfound explosion of productivity was amazing. I felt like the star of a tampon advert, ready to go skydiving or white-water rafting just because I could. In summary: hooray for slings.

Having the baby out in public has only helped to reinforce what an unbearable stereotype of a proud dad I’m becoming. All I ever want to do is hang out with my family, preferably with my boy sleeping on me. When that’s not happening, I miss it. I miss the weight and warmth of him,

<|begin_of_text|>Republican congresswomen appear more "feminine" than their Democrat counterparts, according to a new study by UCLA psychology researchers.

"Female politicians with stereotypically feminine facial features are more likely to be Republican than Democrat, and the correlation increases the more conservative the lawmaker's voting record," said study author Colleen M. Carpinella, a UCLA graduate student in psychology, in an article posted to the UCLA Newsroom website.

So what makes a woman "stereotypically feminine?"

Certainly, individuals are easily biased by outside factors not related to facial characteristics, including hair style, application of cosmetics, jewelry or clothing style, said Kerri Johnson, the study's senior author and an assistant professor of communication studies and psychology at UCLA. For this reason, the researchers used a computer program that was "immune to those influences."

The program, called FaceGen, allows the researchers to measure more than 100 subtle dimensions including the shape of the jaw, the location of eyebrows, the placement of cheek bones, the shape of eyes and the contour of the forehead, to create a score ranging from -40 (highly male-typed) to +40 (highly female-typed).

For the study, the researchers had FaceGen analyze the portraits of members of the 111th House of Representatives, measuring how closely the facial features of each face approached the average for their gender.

The researchers also studied the faces of male politicians, although those findings were not as revealing, according to the authors. Republicans averaged a less masculine appearance than their Democrat counterparts -- a finding that Carpinella said may suggest that Republican men do not have to exhibit masculinity through their appearance.

The findings for female representatives were more telling, however. Republican women rated more "extremely feminine" or more "sex-typical," according to Johnson. The connection was so strong, the press release notes, that when photos of the same politicians were shown to a batch of undergrads, the students were able to guess with very high accuracy the political affiliations of those women who had been rated most and least "sex-typical."

When the undergraduates guessed that a politician was Republican, their judgments were 98 percent more likely to be accurate for women with the highest rankings for femininity; the accuracy of their judgments increased the more feminine the politician's face. When the undergraduates guessed that a politician was Democrat, their judgments were 58 percent less likely to be accurate for more feminine-looking women, and the accuracy of their judgments decreased the more feminine the politician's face.

When it comes to suicidal behaviour, there is a clear gender paradox: the ratio of men to women who actually commit suicide is three to one, but with attempted suicides it is exactly the opposite -- three women for every one man. A study by the MedUni Vienna which has recently been published in the highly journal Sex Roles demonstrates that the cultural script that bears partial responsibility for this is also found in the reports by Austrian daily newspapers.

These gender-specific differences are made visible by the formulation, the nature and frequency of reported suicide motives. Articles about suicide in women focus more on sociability, relationships with other people and motives that are anchored in the family environment. Psychiatric illnesses are also cited as a motive and are described in a stigmatizing manner. More complex language and cautious expressions are also the hallmarks of articles about female suicide. In contrast, the articles about male suicide use more words that relate to anger and rejection. This conservative role image that pervades Austria anyway is reinforced by this style of reporting.

Suicide risk could be reduced by changing the style of reporting

But that's not all. A very specific problem arises from this, which study leader Brigitte Eisenwort from the University Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the MedUni Vienna explains as follows: "Mental illnesses are described in a stigmatising way and are also generally under-represented, since they are barely mentioned at all in reports about suicidal men. This means that one key approach to prevention fails to register in the minds of Austrian readers. Psychiatric illnesses can be treated. The suicide risk can be reduced as a result." Journalists should therefore take care to present as correct a view as possible of suicidal tendencies and not revert to stereotypical portrayals of men and women.

Spotlight on eleven Austrian daily newspapers

507 articles containing the word'suicide' from eleven Austrian daily newspapers from between 1997 and 2005 were investigated. The study is one of the first investigations to look comprehensively at the subject of gender-specific patterns in the reporting of suicide. This ground-breaking study was set up under the leadership of Brigitte Eisenwort, together with Thomas Niederkrotenthaler and Benedikt Till (both from the Institute for Social Medicine at the MedUni Vienna's Centre for Public Health), as well as Barbara Hinter

All is catered for within the sweepingly incoherent stance that the Labour Party has adopted in advance of the general election.

Marx’s famous observation, that history happens, as it were, twice (first as tragedy, then as farce) is one that the party would do well to remember. Because, if this is a re-run for Labour, the precedent suggests a longer term decline.

The last time Labour attempted to regain power from the Tories after a single term, it was led by an eccentric leftist intellectual, Michael Foot. Miliband may have the intellect and the eccentricity, but as his policy-lite posturing has demonstrated, the party remains terrified of a coherent ideological challenge to right wing Tory policy.

This re-run of tragedy for Labour will be rendered farcical by the overwhelmingly weak content of its campaign. The party’s 1983 manifesto, notoriously dubbed the ‘longest suicide note in history’, may have been an attempt by the right of the party to clear out left wing policies such as nuclear disarmament, knowing that the election would be lost anyway. It did however present Labour as a distinct ideological alternative to Thatcherism on a number of issues. In 2015, there are no radical policies in Labour’s bid for power. The acute trauma of electoral politics in the 1980s has, in large part, meant that politics in Britain has scarcely progressed since.

In response, Labour has become trapped by its attachment to a studied silence on major economic issues. Indirectly, this results in an ongoing expression of various forms of identity politics, the roots of which lie in the emergence of a new-left that came to emphasise minority rights and social-cultural emancipation. Though this turn was a welcome and radical development against the forces of conservatism a quarter of a century ago, today it has left a residual husk. A nominal ‘left’ in UK politics tacitly accepts an enormously unjust economic order and denies any legitimate expression of class as a foundation for politics.

Of course, the siloing of the social and the economic is an ultimately false division. The history of Scotland, the north of England and Wales in the past quarter century is an object lesson in this. Labour have done nothing, post-Blair, to recognise the shape of these problems in the heartlands. The drastic and necessary recalibr

Tomato farmer Wayne Smith said he has never been able to keep a staff of American workers in his 25 years of farming. “People in Alabama are not going to do this,” said Smith, who grows about 75 acres of tomatoes in the northeast part of the state. “They’d work one day and then just wouldn’t show up again.” At his farm, field workers get $2 for every 25-pound box of tomatoes they fill. Skilled pickers can make anywhere from $200 to $300 a day, he said.

Unskilled workers make much less. A crew of four Hispanics can earn about $150 each by picking 250-300 boxes of tomatoes in a day, said Jerry Spencer, of Grow Alabama, which purchases and sells locally owned produce. A crew of 25 Americans recently picked 200 boxes — giving them each $24 for the day. It may make sense for some to sit on the couch. Unemployment benefits provide up to $265 a week while a minimum wage job, at $7.25 an hour for 40 hours, brings in $290.

Alabama farmers are getting killed by a new draconian law that has chased thousands of undocumented immigrants out of the state.

This is brutal work, which is why slaves were once imported to do it, and why it's work now done by the lowest rungs of the socio-economic ladder—immigrants. Just think about the numbers above—four Latinos picked a quarter to a third more tomatoes than a crew of 25 Americans. And sure, those Americans could learn to be more efficient and skilled at the work, but they won't, because they won't put up with that kind of abuse on their bodies (and minds, for that matter) in three-digit temperatures.

This is the same problem that Georgia farmers face, as that state cracks down on undocumented immigrants. As one Georgia farmer laments,

<|begin_of_text|>Two guys walk into a bar. They order beers. Bartender says they don’t have any beer. The men look confused. A stranger in a stylish hat suggests they try something different. They order a clear malt beverage. It’s on ice, clear, delicious. The men are happy.

The entire ad spot lasts 30 seconds, or roughly the same amount of time Zima could claim to be among the most popular adult beverages in the country.

In 1991, with beer sales on the decline across the industry, the Coors company of Golden, Colorado decided to blend two of the hottest trends in consumer marketing: “clear” products like Crystal Pepsi and the smooth, gently-intoxicating appeal of wine coolers. By using charcoal to filter the color and taste from their brews, they were able to deliver a vaguely citrus-tasting drink with 4.7 percent alcohol content. The company asked third-party marketing firm Lexicon Branding to give it a name; Jane Espenson, who would later become a staff writer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Game of Thrones, dubbed it Zima, the Russian word for "winter."

Armed with a $180 million budget for the 1994 launch, Coors peppered television with commercials featuring a spokesman who exchanged his s's for z's. (“What’s your zign?”) They also pushed a slew of merchandising and even an early consumer-use product website.

The goal was to get Zima on the minds and into the hands of young males. Owing to the blanket advertising assault, that's exactly what they accomplished. Zima sold a staggering 1.3 million barrels’ worth of product in 1994, giving it a near-instant 1 percent market share in the booze industry. It was estimated that 70 percent of all drinkers tried the “malternative."

As Coors would soon learn, those numbers only work in your favor if people like the product. The company was disappointed to learn that many of them didn’t: Men found the taste off-putting. And those who enjoyed it were precisely the demographic they were looking to avoid.

Women who normally passed over beer embraced Zima, giving it an effete quality that marketing considered to be grim death for the valued male customer base. If a man couldn’t feel manly taking a pull of the clear stuff, he'd be likely to reach for something else.

On the public relations side, Coors was also having to defend itself against charges that teenagers were growing fond

But for most couples, the tests, which are unregulated, simply answer the boy-or-girl question weeks earlier than ultrasound, and in a less invasive and safer way than amniocentesis.

“Seven weeks is a different time in pregnancy,” said Dr. James Egan, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Connecticut Health Center who was a co-author of a study on sex selection with Dr. Chapman and others. “Women haven’t had the ultrasound where you see the fetus that looks like a baby. Many people don’t even know that a woman is pregnant. And you can have a medical termination,” using pills like RU-486, which can be used at home discreetly before 10 weeks of pregnancy.

There is evidence that some Americans want to choose their babies’ sex. At the Fertility Institutes, a set of clinics in Los Angeles, New York and Guadalajara, Mexico, 85 percent of roughly 500 couples each year seek sex selection, although three-quarters of them come from overseas, said Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, the medical director.

“It’s jumped over the past four years,” said Dr. Steinberg, whose clinics determine sex through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, an embryo screening that also detects genetic disorders. He said that “if a woman calls to make the appointment, the couple almost always wants a female. If a man calls, they almost always want a male.”

But clinics and some ethicists say this type of sex selection is more acceptable because it occurs before embryos are implanted, before pregnancy.

“We’re trying to prevent the abortion,” said Dr. Jamie Grifo, program director for New York University’s Fertility Center. His and other clinics typically allow sex selection for couples with two or more children, parents interested in “family balancing,” adding a child of the opposite sex.

“For someone who has two girls and wants to have a boy, so each sibling can grow up with brother and sister, what’s wrong with that?” Dr. Grifo said.

Still, the cost and commitment of the fertility process makes such sex selection cases relatively unusual. Fetal DNA tests, costing between $250 and $350, are more affordable.

Anti-abortion groups are incorporating sex selection in legislative agendas. Arizona and Oklahoma recently passed laws banning sex-selected abortion

<|begin_of_text|>Testers need to learn to code *. Period.

And here’s why.

The market demands it and the supply is arriving.

As a hiring manager I’ve personally seen a massive increase in the number of testers who can now code. They may not be able to write production grade feature code, or automated tests, but they can write scripts to help them test, or they can write a small app that will inject data or they can extend an Open Source tool to make it work for their needs.

They can basically dig deeper than what you see on the screen, do more with automation and do a more varied set of testing by using tools and code. I see this as a positive thing – I know some people may not.

There is also a growing number of developers who are moving in to a technical testing capacity and learning how to do good exploratory testing and test planning. The market is buoyant for testers who code (and who know how to sell themselves) and it’s good for hiring managers. It’s quite rare now for me to find a tester who isn’t coding, or at least really focused on learning it.

In a nutshell the market is now being supplied with these once elusive testers who can code.

You could of course replace “learn to code” with “learn to do security testing” or “learn to do performance testing” but the reality is that most of these niches also require coding or scripting experience. It’s rare to find a tool that pops out of a box and does what you want it to do – despite what many of the tool vendors sales people will tell you.

To ignore the shift in the market is to leave yourself at a disadvantage when trying to get a job.

Whether you believe that coding is essential to being a good tester or not will soon become an irrelevant moral viewpoint. Testers now need to remain relevant to those with jobs, and those people with jobs for offer are starting to get multi-skilled testers (or T-Shaped as I call them) applying.

Instead of investing energy in fighting the inevitable train of change it might be worth spending that time learning to script, or carving out a niche in another aspect of testing (security, usability, off-shoring, test management etc), or resigning yourself to being outpaced in job applications.

We should be careful though to discern from simply following trends such as certifications and following evolutions in how testing is done. One is very dangerous and leads to lazy recruiting and competitions like certification inflation – the other is a natural progression of our testing craft.

<|begin_of_text|>Australia’s Jill Rathborne may have added a new term to the already crowded field of politically correct academese: “micro-inequity.”

Not encouraged to study science while growing up, Rathborne says she was told by her teachers that college physics classes “would be too difficult.”

She admits, however, that none of the teachers she had asked had taken physics at college, “so that might have influenced their opinions.”

“That conversation didn’t explicitly mention my gender, but I do wonder if they gave that same advice to male students that had similar abilities to me (I was in the top few percent of my high school physics class),” she says.

The Guardian reports:

The problem is these biases are often subtle. It’s these micro-inequities that do the most damage – the small, seemingly inconsequential ways in which people are excluded or discounted that, over time, erode confidence, value and worth and reinforce a culture that is not inclusive. BD: Has there been a moment in your career when you’ve been uncomfortably reminded of your gender? JR: It’s that thought in the back of your mind: am I getting this opportunity because I’m qualified, or because I’m female? Hopefully the former, but perhaps sometimes it might be the latter. I’d like to be known as a scientist, not a female scientist – maybe, if possible, a good scientist. The relevant point here is that typically we wouldn’t ever ask a man this same question when asking him about his career. BD: Have you been encouraged to modify behavior in masculine environments? JR: Astronomy is a very male-dominated field – this is evident in the office, at conferences, in committee memberships. I can’t recall ever being actively told to modify my behaviour, [but] having said that, it takes a certain resilience and personality to be comfortable and successful when you’re a minority in your field. You often need a pretty thick skin, you can’t be easily offended.

So, even though none of her teachers made any point about her being female (and who, by the way, probably had a very good idea about her academic abilities), and though she can’t recall any “active” request to change her behavior in the male-dominated arena, it’s just “that thought in the back of [her] mind …”

Not to mention, Rathborne bemoans a “non-inclusive culture” … yet wonders if she got her position merely because of her gender?

Now, a significant obstacle to the development of next-generation device technologies appears to have been overcome, according to researchers from the University of Tokyo (Japan), Tokyo Institute of Technology (Japan) and Ho Chi Minh University of Pedagogy (Vietnam).

Specializing in the emerging field of semiconductor spintronics, the team has become the first to report growing iron-doped ferromagnetic semiconductors working at room temperature -- a longstanding physical constraint. Doping is the practice of adding atoms of impurities to a semiconductor lattice to modify electrical structure and properties. Ferromagnetic semiconductors are valued for their potential to enhance device functionality by utilizing the spin degrees of freedom of electrons in semiconductor devices.

"Bridging semiconductor and magnetism is desirable because it would provide new opportunities of utilizing spin degrees of freedom in semiconductor devices," explained research leader Masaaki Tanaka, Ph.D., of the Department of Electrical Engineering & Information Systems, and Center for Spintronics Research Network, University of Tokyo. "Our approach is, in fact, against the traditional views of material design for ferromagnetic semiconductors. In our work, we have made a breakthrough by growing an iron-doped semiconductor which shows ferromagnetism up to room temperature for the first time in semiconductors that have good compatibility with modern electronics. Our results open a way to realize semiconductor spintronic devices operating at room temperature."

The researchers discuss their findings this week in Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing. The researchers' maverick move challenged the prevailing theory that predicted a type of semiconductor known as "wide band gap" would be strongly ferromagnetic. Most research focuses on the wide band gap approach. "We instead chose narrow-gap semiconductors, such as indium arsenide, or gallium antimonide, as the host semiconductors," Tanaka said. This choice enabled them to obtain ferromagnetism and conserve it at room temperature by adjusting doping concentrations.

Investigators have long envisioned bridging semiconductors and magnetism to create new opportunities of utilizing spin degrees of freedom and harnessing electron spin in semiconductors. But until now, ferromagnetic semiconductors have only worked under experimental conditions at extremely low, cold temperatures, typically lower than 200 K (-73oC), which is much colder than the freezing

Blame the identity apostles – they led us down this path to populism | Simon Jenkins Read more

Fashion in collective abuse seeks comfort in crowds. In choosing “pale, stale males” (PSMs) for ritual contempt, identity politics has found a target that it hopes will confess its “guilt”. More recently the epithet “failed” has been added to explain the Brexit/Trump voters. These PSMs are further damned by being uneducated “left-behinders”, and therefore also dumb. They were thought so dumb it was suggested they vote again on Brexit, for having got it wrong first time.

Were someone such as I to take offence, demand redress or “protected space”, I would be bidden to shut up, get a life and not be so sensitive. I might plead, with Shylock: “Hath not a [pale, stale male] hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? If you prick us, do we not bleed?” I might turn to Kant and universalise the judgment. What if I were to follow “hideously” with black, female, Jewish, Arab, obese, disabled or Welsh? Is the representation of black footballers in the Premier League (as opposed to the Football Association) “hideously black”?

The reality is that PMSs are expected to take all this in their stride. They were, after all, the old hegemons. They dished out discrimination; now they should accept a taste of their own medicine. (Or will someone protest that this is patronising: why should PSMs refuse to take offence, as does everyone else?) This is, of course, fair enough – except two wrongs do not make a right. Besides, identity liberalism is surely more than the politics of tit-for-tat. It is a straining after a sort of equality of treatment.

Hertz IT employees share two things with the Carrier workers: They were also angry, and they got the news on the same day, Feb. 10.

The Carrier layoffs arrived guillotine-like; the plant is closing, period. But IT layoffs are rarely like that. There are ambiguities and uncertainties and lifeboats for some, and so it was at Hertz.

In an early morning conference call, Hertz's IT employees were told by the CIO the firm was expanding its outsourcing work with IBM. It wasn't known then how many would lose their jobs or ultimately be hired by IBM.

But one month later, this much is clear: About 300 Hertz IT employees, most located in Oklahoma City, were impacted by this decision. IBM is hiring about 75 and those workers are expecting to receive offers today. The layoffs will begin this month and be completed by May 31, said Hertz. It's not yet clear if all the 225 or so employees who are not receiving job offers from IBM will be laid off.

After the conference call, employees were stunned. The reaction was, "We're screwed," said an IT employee, one of two interviewed, who requested his name not be used.

There was "anger, resentment," especially by employees who "sacrificed that work/life balance to keep things going here," said the employee.

Hertz took precautions. On the day that IT employees learned that their work was shifting to IBM, employees noticed Oklahoma sheriff patrol vehicles in the building's parking lot. They believed plainclothes officers were inside the building.

Hertz explained the security decision. "We consider the safety and security of our people whenever there are circumstances or events that could increase the risk of a disturbance or some form of workplace violence," said Bill Masterson, a Hertz spokesman.

"Knowing that this was a difficult announcement, we had additional security on hand," said Masterson. This security was in place from Wednesday Feb. 10 through Friday, Feb. 12.

There were two opinions about the security, said the employees. Some saw it as prudent, while others thought it a sign of distrust. There were no reported problems.

Once the initial shock passed, Hertz IT employees had to make difficult choices.

<|begin_of_text|>Amalie Emmy Noether[a] ( German: [ˈnøːtɐ]; 23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics.[1] She invariably used the name "Emmy Noether" in her life and publications.[a] She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.[2] As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed the theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.[4]

Noether was born to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; her father was a mathematician, Max Noether. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her habilitation was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent.

Noether remained a leading member of the Göttingen mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the "Noether boys". In 1924, Dutch mathematician B.L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas: Her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and, despite signs of a recovery,

<|begin_of_text|>Neanderthal communities divided some of their tasks according to their sex. This is one of the main conclusions reached by a study performed by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), published in the Journal of Human Evolution. This study, which analyzed 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 individuals from three different sites (El Sidron, in Asturias -- Spain, L'Hortus in France, and Spy in Belgium), reveals that the dental grooves present in the female fossils follow the same pattern, which is different to that found in male individuals.

Analyses show that all Neanderthal individuals, regardless of age, had dental grooves. According to Antonio Rosas, CSIC researcher at the Spanish National Museum of Natural Sciences: "This is due to the custom of these societies to use the mouth as a third hand, as in some current populations, for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat, for instance."

Rosas specifies that "what we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men. Therefore we assume that the tasks performed were different."

Other variables analyzed are the tiny spalls of the teeth enamel. Male individuals show a greater number of nicks in the enamel and dentin of the upper parts, while in female individuals these imperfections appear in the lower parts.

It is still unclear which activities corresponded to women and which ones to men. However, the authors of the study note that, as in modern hunter-gatherer societies, women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of garments. Researchers state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task.

Almudena Estalrrich, CSIC researcher at the Spanish National Museum of Natural Sciences, adds: "Nevertheless, we believe that the specialization of labor by sex of the individuals was probably limited to a few tasks, as it is possible that both men and women participated equally in the hunting of big animals."

Rosas concludes: "The study of Neanderthals has provided numerous discoveries in recent years. We have moved from thinking of them as little evolved beings, to know that they took care of the sick persons, buried their deceased, ate seafood, and even had different physical features than expected: there were redhead individuals, and with light skin and eyes. So far, we thought that the sexual division of labor was typical of sapiens societies, but apparently that's not true

With the domestic talent pool shrinking, Japan desperately needs foreign talent to fill the gap and revive its ailing economy. Especially IT engineers, where the country is expected to face a shortage of 600,000 positions.

That’s why Tokyo is reaching to Asian countries like India, where it has launched a program called Project Indian Institutes of Technology (PIITs), inviting students from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) to spend their internships at Japanese firms.

Apparently, Tokyo hopes that some of these Indian engineers will opt to stay with Japanese firms beyond the internship time.

But judging from the overwhelming response to a previous piece of ours on the topic, Asian talent doesn’t seem eager to work in Japan.

The problem? Japan isn’t prepared to provide what foreign talent needs — a career, due to the lack of the right “regime,” the socioeconomic conditions and cultural mindset, prevailing in Japanese corporations.

In fact, Indians are better off home. New Delhi is better prepared than Tokyo to attract and retain talent.

That’s one of the key findings of the 2016-17 International Competitiveness report (World Economic Forum), which ranks India 23 in the capacity to attract talent -- well ahead of Japan, which ranks 77. Also, India ranks ahead of Japan in the capacity to retain talent—see table.

Lauper probably wasn't trying to make a sociological statement in her head-bopping anthem, but her lyrics point to a much-debated question about gender differences. In studying the relative happiness of people across the globe, do men and women exhibit distinctive emotional characteristics? In short, is one sex generally happier than the other?

It's important to note that evaluating happiness isn't a highly precise scientific undertaking. For one thing, happiness is a subjective term, and there's no universal measurement for it. Though someone smiles on the outside, it doesn't mean that his or her apparent joy reflects internally. Similarly, a lot of studies related to happiness rely on self-reporting. One survey that economists from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania have used simply asks respondents to rate themselves on whether they are "very happy," "pretty happy" or "not happy." The resulting statistics don't take into account the nuances and background information of why and how people scored themselves.

Despite the potential pitfalls of empirical happiness studies, we can draw some conclusions about who the happiest sociological groups of people are. Generally, older people are happier than younger ones. Wealth and good health also give us something to smile about more often. Yet when it comes to the happiness gender gap, things aren't so cut and dried.

The 2003 Pew Global Attitudes Project that surveyed 38,000 men and women across 44 countries lends insight into the disparities between male and female happiness. Overall, women scored themselves as more satisfied with their lives than men [source: Pew Research Center]. Moreover, women from certain countries, including Pakistan, Japan and Argentina, appeared significantly happier. The differences between what affects men and women's levels of happiness explains this slight gender gap. Women, for instance, tend to focus on personal and domestic problems, while men concern themselves more with matters outside of the home.

This variation in values is also reflected in how the recent recession has affected people's happiness. According to a Nielson Happiness Survey conducted in 51 countries, men's happiness hasn't weathered the economic storm well since they attach more importance to financial success than women. On the other hand, the women surveyed indicated they appreciated quality relationships above all [source: Reuters].

Vi deler samfundet op i indvandrere og danskere, men opdelingen skal være mænd og kvinder.

Ikke i indvandrere og danskere. Når der tales om problemer i samfundet, så er det problemer blandt den mandlige del af befolkningen.

Nu er der ikke problemer med alle mænd, ligesom det ikke er alle indvandrere, der er kriminelle og utilpassede. Selv om man nogle gange kan få den opfattelse i pressen, er det selvfølgelig heller ikke alle mænd, der er kriminelle og utilpassede, men det er blandt den mandlige del af befolkningen, de store samfundsmæssige og sociale problemer findes.

Vi hører ikke om det – det er et usynligt problem – men ja, vi ved da godt at en pædofil er en mand, at voldtægt begås af mænd, men det understreges ikke.

En notits fra avisen siger »færre kræves fængslet, antallet af unge indvandrere, der ender i grundlovsforhør, falder«. Hvem er det, der ender i grundlovsforhør? Det er mænd! Uanset hvilken etnisk kategori de tilhører, så er det mænd, det fremhæves bare ikke. Vi hører ikke om det.

Hvad med overskriften fra Politiken tirsdag 29. august: ’Hård kurs mod unge spiller fallit’. Hvem er de unge. Hvis man læser artiklen, fremgår det, at det er unge mænd. Man kan tro, at problemet er blandt alle unge, men det er det ikke, det er unge mænd indsatsen er rettet mod, jo selvfølgelig er der også piger, men de udgør en forsvindende lille del af problemet.

Kriminalitet er et kønsbestemt problem, et mandeproblem. En ekstrem mandlig adfærd.

Der skrives om vold, men det er ikke bare vold, nej det er mænds vold, mænds vold mod kvinder, børn og andre mænd

A Global News investigation found multiple cases where the driver was never criminally charged. Instead the person was charged under the Highway Traffic Act (HTA) and the offence often resulted in a few thousand dollars fine.

RELATED: 87 year old Winnipeg cyclist identified as victim of Friday’s crash

Leslie Freudenberg, 87, was an avid cyclist. But in July 2016, his passion got him killed. Freudenberg was struck by a piece of heavy machinery.

“He was riding his bike down a cyclist pathway and was crossing the street,” his son-in-law, Keith Johnson, told Global News. “A piece of heavy equipment was being transported down the street and didn’t have a full view for the driver. He didn’t even know that he actually hit my father-in-law.”

Freudenberg was killed instantly. The 34-year-old driver was never charged. Instead, PCL Construction, the company that owned the truck, is going to court for not providing a clear view to the driver. The Manitoba Justice department said the maximum penalty the company will face is a $2,000 fine.

“I guess the cruel nature of all of that is the fact that the family has never really been given the opportunity for closure at this point,” Johnson said. “We’ve paid the ultimate price in losing a family member that we’ll never get back.”

This scenario – a pedestrian or cyclist is hit and killed and the driver receives a light penalty – is playing out across the country. Global News has spoken to many families from coast to coast who are outraged that careless drivers aren’t facing stiffer fines after hitting and killing their loved ones.

WATCH: Life is cheap: Trudi Mason recounts harrowing story of losing her friend to a pickup truck

Trudi Mason of Lethbridge, Alta. was cycling with her best friend when a truck hit the both of them. Mason’s friend died. Mason says the court process ignores the fact a person was killed.

The family feels Freudenberg’s death could have been prevented had PCL followed equipment protocol. Instead, the incident happened as the driver was moving the heavy machinery from one end of the street to the other.

“Les’ death hasn’t been taken seriously,” Johnson said. “It’s the worst slap in the face that we could ever experience. It just further denies any closure that the family has to put this behind them.”

Freudenberg’s tragic death is just one of many similar cases

<|begin_of_text|>Polar bear hairs are hollow to maximize insulating qualities of the animals' fur, as almost every student of the Arctic knows.

But now a set of studies from China shows polar bear hairs are much more than simple tiny tubes.

Detailed mathematical analysis of the hairs, published in the journal Thermal Science, finds they have complex structures that make them much better insulators than simple hollow hairs would be.

Microscopic examination of polar bear hairs reveals their interior is a structure of membrane pores, researchers from several Chinese universities have found. The latest analysis finds the pore structure is arranged as a fractal, a series of repeating patterns spun off into smaller dimensions.

Calculation of the pore structure finds the ratio of its dimensions to be close to a mathematical figure known as the "golden mean," the ideal dimension ratio for an infinitely spiraling fractal, says one study. The dimension ratio of the inner structure of the analyzed polar-bear hair was calculated at 1.625, close to the golden mean, which is also called Phi and is approximately 1.618; the golden mean "must reveal the possible optimal structure of polar bear hairs," the study says.

Though it appears white, polar bear fur is translucent, helping it absorb environmental heat, the study points out. Without the interior pores' fractal arrangement, however, the translucent hair that absorbs light could easily send heat back out into the environment, the study says.

A related study, with some of the same co-authors, calculates the equation for one-dimensional heat conduction through each "labyrinth cavity" of the hair. The authors used calculus to arrive at a differential equation showing how heat moves through the hairs.

The studies -- the latest in a series on the same subject by the same group of Chinese researchers -- are not mere academic exercises.

Understanding the structure and workings of polar-bear hairs "may find many potential applications in the future, especially in thermal insulation designs for extreme cases," said an earlier study by some of the same authors, published in 2011 in Thermal Science.

They note in their studies that polar bears maintain body temperatures of 98.6 degrees in an environment where temperatures can dip as low as minus 76 degrees.

The Chinese researchers are not alone in looking to polar-bear hair as a model for future heat-collecting and heat-holding products.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

Don’t be deceived”This advertisement for intolerance, which belies intelligence on this subject is now in Manhattan parked in front of the UN building and says something slightly different in English:“Its biology…Boys are boys and always will be and girls are girls and always will be. You can’t change sex. Respect all”Never mind that message is written by people who understand nothing and most importantly are confusing gender identity with sexual organs and I won’t surprise you by telling you it has been funded by 3 right wing conservative groups one of whom is called the National Organization for Marriage.Of the Spanish version, one Madrid councilman declared it the “bus of shame,” and city officials ordered it removed from the streets for violating a traffic law restricting advertising on private vehicles.“We need a discussion about how to respect everyone,” says Joseph Grabowski who is a representative for one of the groups. But he also claimed that being transgender is a “disorder” and that a respectful discussion does not extend to recognizing a transgender person’s gender identity in public settings. (The American Psychiatric Association does not classify being transgender as a mental disorder.) He also added, “They can live that out privately.”Not only are these groups profoundly ignorant of science and reality but they also represent a dangerous new backlash trend among the “earth is flat crowd”; the very same ones that occupy the Bible belt in the United States and voted for Donald Trump. They can also be found in every country in the world usually also denying climate change, women’s rights and decrying homosexuality as a sin.Let’s hope that their message does not receive a receptive ear and enough people take exception in order to educate the sponsors although I suspect that wouldn’t have much effect on those who've already drunk the Kool-Aid.Is it not the least bit ironic that the "respect all" in their message doesn't ring a bell of contradiction in their minds?<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Modi is the King now. Don’t be surprised. He holds the title of the Prime Minister. But he wields so much unbridled power that he is virtually no less than a king. Modi has always had the dream to have power that none could question him. Indeed, the Cabinet reshuffle on Sunday has put him in a position where no one can even raise a finger in Modi’s presence. He no longer shares power with anybody in his council of ministers. Rather he himself is the source of power for his ministers.

Power sharing is the basic principle of the parliamentary system of governance wherein the Prime Minister and his council of ministers take a decision with consensus. A Prime Minister is therefore called the first among equals in the parliamentary system which India has adopted right from its inception as a free nation.

This system ensures check upon a Prime Minister from turning an autocrat because ministers act upon him/her as a balancing force. They work in the interest of the region they represent. This, in turn, puts a democratic pressure on a Prime Minister while taking a decision.

But Modi is not the one to bear any restrictions when it comes to exercising power. He is temperamentally an autocrat. He is essentially a narcissist who is deeply impressed with himself. He not just believes himself to be destined to change the destiny of ‘1.5 billion Indians’. But he is also convinced that he alone can serve the country the best. This pattern of thinking is very much anti-democratic and such charecters always transform into an autocrat.

Narendra Modi has often said about himself that he left his “family for the country”. The country is supreme for him and even over and above his own family. It is also the RSS belief. No RSS functionary can have a family. Modi was so impressed with the RSS that he left behind his bride and never went back to his family. He ‘devoted’ his life to the country, as he himself claims.

So, Modi’s idea of India is based on the Sangh’s idea of the country which, in turn, is Hindu Rashtra. It very much reflects in Modi’s style of governance right from the Gujarat riots to mob lynching of minorities. A Hindu Rashtra is not feasible within a democratic system because in such a system, decision-making to be democratic. So, Modi’s worry was how to turn the system upside down to wield unbridled power to construct a “new India” of his ideas!

Modi ultimately found a way out through the Cabinet resh

<|begin_of_text|>Executive orders issued by Presidents of the United States to help officers and agencies of the executive branch manage operations within the government.

At the federal level of government in the United States, laws are made almost exclusively by legislation. Such legislation originates as an Act of Congress passed by the United States Congress; such acts were either signed into law by the President or passed by Congress after a presidential veto.

However, legislation is not the only source of regulations. There is also judge-made common law and constitutional law. The President can issue executive orders pursuant to a grant of discretion from Congress, or under the inherent powers that office holds to deal with certain matters which have the force of law.

Many early executive orders were not recorded.

Helion, Helioff. It's not as bad as that at all, but the effort made to compete with AWS is over, for now. HP is backing away from the pubic cloud and going for perhaps a safer, and more lucrative, future in the private cloud. It's my guess that inevitably, HP will make a better return on assets this way. The changes will be frustrating to planners, perhaps, but the cloud-on-the-hoof turf war is largely over.

Face it: It's brutal out there. Commodity infrastructure portends that margins will be slim. Amazon knows know to make microprofits. HP is a machine that needs more revenue per SKU. There's nothing like not making money and making up for it in volume. HP's Helion isn't dead by any means, rather, it's becoming focused infrastructure, in my opinion.

Rackspace was rumored to be for sale, something I find hard to believe (in fact, the company said in September that "it has ended its evaluation of alternatives that would result in Rackspace being acquired" and was planning to go forward independently). OpenStack languishes because it's too tough for many people to get their heads around. The market size seems smaller than everyone had dreamed.

Microsoft dropped its traditional pre-announcement of an ought-to-be-available in a hoped-for future release, Docker on Windows, and their own competitor to skinny operating systems, the Windows 2016 Nano Server, a seemingly impossible sort of substrate for the new rage of containers.

<|begin_of_text|>What does the word "rape" mean to you? For many reading this post, I suspect, it is a trigger to appalling events in their own lives. Because rape is an everyday crime. By my calculations, roughly 230 people are raped each day in England and Wales.

Police, this morning, called for specialist units to investigate rape allegations - senior officers are ashamed of a conviction rate they calculate at 6%. "Not good enough" says the Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police John Yates.

But analysis of the Home Office data on what they call "intimate violence" suggests the conviction rate is much lower. And the scale of the problem far greater. My source is the Home Office supplement to the British Crime Survey - Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence 2006/07 (pdf link). This is a remarkable piece of research in which 13,000 people were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire on their experiences of domestic violence, sexual assault and rape.

It is an exercise that has been conducted three times now and is backed up by other academic studies. The results are consistent. One in 20 women said they had been raped since they were 16. One in 200 said they had been raped in the previous 12 months. In terms of the population of England and Wales, that suggests 85,000 women are raped each year - 230 a day. And yet the number of men convicted of rape is fewer than 800 a year. So the chance of a victim seeing her attacker jailed is less than one in 100.

But rape is a complex crime. Only 17% of rapists are strangers to their victim. Just 4% are cases of date rape. Half (54%) are committed by a husband, partner or ex-partner. What's more, even though their experience is technically rape in law, 57% of rape victims don't necessarily think of themselves that way.

To be clear what the figures categorise as rape, the definition is this: "the penetration of the vagina or anus without consent and penetration of the mouth by a penis without consent."

Since the 39,000 people who have taken part in the studies benefited nothing from alleging rape, and the results appear consistent, it seems probable that the research gives a realistic sense of the scale.

If one looks at the data on rape at any point during adult life, it suggests 700,000 women have suffered in that way - equivalent to the entire population of Leeds.

It’s about sodium-loaded pork fat, stinky triple-cream cheeses, the tender thymus glands and distended livers of young animals. It’s about danger—risking the dark, bacterial forces of beef, chicken, cheese, and shellfish. Your first two hundred and seven Wellfleet oysters may transport you to a state of rapture, but your two hundred and eighth may send you to bed with the sweats, chills, and vomits. Gastronomy is the science of pain. Professional cooks belong to a secret society whose ancient rituals derive from the principles of stoicism in the face of humiliation, injury, fatigue, and the threat of illness. The members of a tight, well-greased kitchen staff are a lot like a submarine crew. Confined for most of their waking hours in hot, airless spaces, and ruled by despotic leaders, they often acquire the characteristics of the poor saps who were press-ganged into the royal navies of Napoleonic times—superstition, a contempt for outsiders, and a loyalty to no flag but their own. A good deal has changed since Orwell’s memoir of the months he spent as a dishwasher in “Down and Out in Paris and London.” Gas ranges and exhaust fans have gone a long way toward increasing the life span of the working culinarian. Nowadays, most aspiring cooks come into the business because they want to: they have chosen this life, studied for it. Today’s top chefs are like star athletes. They bounce from kitchen to kitchen—free agents in search of more money, more acclaim. I’ve been a chef in New York for more than ten years, and, for the decade before that, a dishwasher, a prep drone, a line cook, and a sous-chef. I came into the business when cooks still smoked on the line and wore headbands. A few years ago, I wasn’t surprised to hear rumors of a study of the nation’s prison population which reportedly found that the leading civilian occupation among inmates before they were put behind bars was “cook.” As most of us in the restaurant business know, there is a powerful strain of criminality in the industry, ranging from the dope-dealing busboy with beeper and cell phone to the restaurant owner who has two sets of accounting books.

<|begin_of_text|>Being feminist means being vegan. You can’t be a true feminist if you’re eating meat.

I read this comment on Facebook and it hit a nerve with me. My first reaction was, “Why should people be telling others what to eat and what not to eat?” The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me for many reasons.

The argument is that being a feminist means addressing all forms of oppression, including oppression of animals. The animal agricultural industry exploits animals. Female animals are forced to breed through artificial or manual insemination. Their youngs are taken from them prematurely. Female chickens are debeaked and grow to be too big for their legs to carry them. Pigs are penned in cages too small for them to move. The theory is that exploitation of the female animal reproductive system is very relevant to feminists fighting against the patriarchy and fighting for human female reproductive rights. Oppression of animals should intersect with oppression of women.

When vegans or feminists make statements like mentioned above, it can come off as very Western-centric, classist, and elitist.

I’ve never felt like going vegan or vegetarian, not because I didn’t understand the plight for animal rights, but because it is something I can’t identify with.

First and most importantly, Hmong culture is a very big part of my identity, and food is Hmong culture. We (family and friends) gather around food. Food is served at birthday parties, religious ceremonies, celebrations, and even during short visits to family. Food is part of family life.

So, why not substitute meat ingredients with vegan products?

Our ancestors cultivated the lands of Laos, Vietnam, and China for farming and livestock. We brought our culture with us when we immigrated to the US as refugees of war after the Vietnam War.

Religious ceremonies, like hu plig (soul calling), require eggs and the sacrifice of chickens and roosters. Other ceremonies involve sacrificial cows, pigs, and sheep/goats. We need chicken’s blood and feathers for the New Year to create a new shrine for our xwm kab. So, how should we perform or practice our religion if we go vegan? What about the cultural custom of dieting only on boiled chicken and herbs 30 days postpartum?

Meat has always been very precious to the Hmong. We don’t waste anything, so the dishes we cook during feasts are from the meat of the animals we sacrifice for religious ceremonies. Food we eat throughout the year are leftover meat from the same animals.

The 1,168 mile-long pipeline is intended to transport crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, passing through South Dakota and Iowa. From there, it will connect with another pipeline to transfer oil to terminals and refineries along the Gulf of México.

However, its construction has hit a snag in Standing Rock, North Dakota. Since September the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and allies from around the world have been pushing hard to prevent the pipeline from cutting through Sioux Treaty territory.

The water protectors maintain–under enormous pressure from the government—that construction of the pipeline must be halted immediately to protect the waters of the Missouri River and “the very survival” of the tribe.

The pipeline will cross under the Missouri River, the longest river in the United States and the sole water source of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

Pipeline ruptures happen all the time. It’s a fact. An excavator might dig in the wrong place. The pipeline might start leaking due to corrosion. It might explode due to poor operation. It could even break due to improper construction or the use of substandard materials.

Scorching land, torching homes—and killing multiple people. Pipeline explosions in 2016 show why the #NoDAPL fight is still going strong: pic.twitter.com/RNVfIAWwaj — Fusion (@Fusion) December 1, 2016

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, over the last 27 years there have been close to 8,000 oil spills in the United States alone. That’s “nearly 300 per year on average.”

If the DAPL were to follow this environmentally destructive trend, there would be far reaching consequences for the Standing Rock Sioux and potentially millions of other Americans.

Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said it best: “The River provides drinking water for communities, cooling water for power plants, and a low-cost highway for goods and agricultural products.”

Contaminated water from North Dakota has the potential to hit twelve states, all the way to Louisiana, wreaking havoc across America’s heartland.

The negative impact of the DAPL has already started. There are claims that the Army Corps of Engineers–the government body that approved the project– cut corners by failing to consult with the tribe before letting the pipeline developers, Energy Transfer Partners, proceed with construction. A failed lawsuit in early September argued that, in doing so, the Corps

WARNING: this article involves feminism. Those offended by the idea of gender equality should STEP AWAY FROM THEIR COMPUTERS NOW and get back inside their caves. Not a misogynist? Then hey buddy, sit back and relax. I’d offer you a cup of tea but you’re miles away (and I don’t have any tea).

Sexism permeates our society, that’s a given, but you might not have realised just how much it occurs in gaming. There are three levels at which it exists: at an industry level, in games themselves, and from within gamers. It’s vital that we are aware of these problems but, more importantly, we have to do our best in tackling them. To do this, we must look at each problem in turn.

First: sexism in the industry. There is evidence that suggests women who work in gaming are under-represented and suffer some of the worst gender-based harassment. Female gamers make up 45% of the gaming population; yet male game designers make up 89% of the industry and earn 23.6% more than their female counterparts. What a kick in the balls vagina. There have also been many high-profile incidents of women being harassed by men in the workplace. One of the most recent stories involved Josh Mattingly, CEO and founder of Indiestatik, publicly apologising and “stepping down” after sending a female game developer inappropriate and unprovoked sexual messages on Facebook.

People have claimed that women should just stand up for themselves and that speaking up against those that harass them should be enough to stop the problem, but there is not always a clear cut solution. The #thatwoman hashtag shows that in speaking up, women are likely to be ostracised and have it limit their future career. Perhaps the risk would be worth the overall benefits, but it is understandable why women in gaming don’t always feel free to confront those that may oppress or belittle them. It would be like Yoshi trying to stand up to Mario – he’s just going to drop Yoshi mid-jump and carry on like nothing happened anyway.

Similarly, the #1reasonwhy hashtag asked women to speak out about why they don’t feel comfortable in the gaming industry. The results included stories of groping and being constantly mistaken for assistants and receptionists.

Uzay Bulut The writer is a Turkish journalist and political analyst formerly based in Ankara. She now lives in the United States. More from the author ► The writer is a Turkish journalist and political analyst formerly based in Ankara. She now lives in the United States.

On August 8, Muslim Turkish Cypriots and illegal settlers from Turkey celebrated the 53rd anniversary of Turkey’s napalm bombing of Greek Cypriot civilians in the Turkish-occupied enclave of Kokkina in Cyprus. Mustafa Akıncı, the president of the self-styled “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (TRNC), which is recognized only by Turkey, also participated in the celebrations.

In August 1964, Turkish warplanes dropped napalm bombs on Kokkina in the Tillyria peninsula, hitting residential areas and a hospital, and killing more than 50 people, including 19 civilians. Ten years later, in 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus and has occupied almost 40 percent of the island ever since.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece issued a note of condemnation regarding the celebrations:

“We are dismayed to note the celebrations of the Turkish Cypriot leadership, including Mr. Akinci himself, of the 53rd anniversary of the use of chemical weapons and dropping of napalm bombs by the Turkish air force on the Tillyria peninsula. This was the first use of banned chemical weapons in the history of our planet.

“Today, when the whole planet bows to the victims of wars and such hostile acts, the holding of and participation in such celebrations is an affront to international law, to the memory of the fallen, and to the whole of humanity.”

The Republic of Cyprus declared independence in 1960. Afterwards, Turkey escalated its preparations to invade the island, which included but were not limited to establishing a bridgehead at Kokkina in 1964 and smuggling arms and fighters from Turkey into the area in order to strengthen Turkish positions there.

According to the High Commission of the Republic of Cyprus in London,

“When in August 1964 the [Cypriot] Government attempted to contain the Kokkina bridgehead, Turkey's air force bombed the National Guard and neighboring Greek villages with napalm and threatened to invade. The other major purpose served by the enclaves was the political and physical separation of the two communities.”

Creating a separate, new legal structure to confer some benefits on same-sex couples neither honors American ideals of fairness, nor does it grant true equality. The results are clearly visible in New Jersey, which continues to deny same-sex couples some of the tangible civil benefits that come with marriage.

Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey has long said that he would sign a measure granting the right to marry to couples of the same sex. We are heartened that he has declared that that should happen sooner rather than later.

We hope Mr. Corzine intends to prod legislators into passing such a law early in the 2009 session. That would make New Jersey the first state to legalize marriage for same-sex couples through legislative action. Three other states — Connecticut, Massachusetts and California — have done so through the courts. Unfortunately, California voters approved a ballot measure in November rescinding that right, at least for now.

Mr. Corzine made his statement after a state commission released its final report on New Jersey’s two-year-old civil union law. The commission noted the hurt and stigma inflicted by shutting out gay people from the institution of marriage. It also found that civil unions do not assure gay couples of the same protections, including the right to collect benefits under a partner’s health insurance program and to make medical decisions on behalf of a partner who is unable to do so. The panel concluded unanimously that the state should enact a law to remove the inequities.

We regret that the leaders of the state’s Democratic-controlled Legislature do not view this issue with the same urgency. Senate President Richard Codey, for instance, said recently that progress in civil rights areas “is typically achieved in incremental steps.” We suspect that political expedience is clouding Mr. Codey’s sense of fairness. Next year in New Jersey, the governorship and all seats in the Assembly are up for grabs in an election. Some Republicans already are talking about making their opposition to same-sex marriage a campaign issue.

Governor Corzine typically takes the right side on important issues, but he has been known to retreat in the face of opposition. We hope that’s not the case here. It’s past time for him and for the Democrats in Trenton to find the political courage to extend the right to marry to gay couples.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

So I’m not going to bother writing out a lengthy justification of why we genuinely need female characters in video games for the good of the industry financially and artistically; if you honestly can’t understand it, go forth and educate yourself. If you feel that gaming is the one thing remaining to men and girls should stop spoiling it with political correctness, then please go boil your head because I see no point in debating with people incapable of basic logic and lacking humanity.

Having taken it as fact that there is a point to including female characters in video games, why on earth are we still hearing excuses for their absence in 2014? Because it is an excuse. There is no reason not to do it. You won’t alienate your existing market by acknowledging the existence of women. You won’t take anything away from your existing market.

Yet another clueless wonder is yapping about the absence of the unnecessary from video games:I am a game designer. I am designing and producing a game that does not, and will not, have a single female character in it. This is not because I am misogynistic. This is not because I do not women to play the game.

We don't put women in the game for the same reason we don't put bunny rabbits or children in the game. Putting women in the game would be an act of brutal sadism, an act of barbarism even by pagan Roman standards. While the Romans did occasionally put female gladiators in the arena, they were there as a comedic act.

Such errors might require cables to be rerouted or walls to be hacked, wasting resources and time and jeopardising the schedules which Mr Yip oversees as senior project manager at Shimizu Corporation's Singapore office.

"Traditionally, we had drawings for each trade," he explains, one set of technical drawings showing electrical works, another showing water pipes, another the walls, and so on.

"Of course, an experienced guy would be able to layer them together and visualise that they will clash. But, inevitably, somebody misses something, there's a clash on site and somebody has to go and fix it."

Today, however, spotting such errors can easily be done by a beginner, or even a computer program. This is thanks to the rise of Building Information Modelling (BIM), a data-heavy virtual 3D-modelling technology that the industry has been increasingly pushed to adopt since the start of the decade.

Since last July, all building plans for new projects with a gross floor area of 5,000 sq m and more have had to be submitted in BIM format for regulatory approval.

The great advantage of BIM software is that it can combine all plans - architectural, engineering, and mechanical and electrical (M&E) - into one integrated model.

"Before, you looked at the 2D drawings, this floor and this floor, and then you tried to visualise whatever intersections there were," says Mr Yip. "Whereas now, you have a model, so it's easier to see clashes."

Recent versions of software are even able to automatically spot and highlight these conflicts.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) announced on Monday the revised fares – a minimum of Rs 10 from the earlier Rs 8 and a maximum of Rs 50.

The 15-km slab, which has been raised from Rs 18 to Rs 30, is likely to hurt daily commuters the most.

The fare structure will change again from October 1 when the minimum fare for travelling a distance of more than 2 km will go up by another Rs 10.

Here’s a calculator to help you find out how much your fare will increase. Just select two stations, and it’ll tell you how much more money you’ll have to pay to ride the Delhi Metro.

<|begin_of_text|>He said, she said. Eddie Cibrian is speaking out once more against his ex-wife, Brandi Glanville.

Last week, Glanville, 44, accused the actor and his current wife, LeAnn Rimes, of allegedly stalking her boyfriend, Donald Friese, on social media. In a series of tweets, she claimed that Rimes, 34, watched four of Friese’s Snapchats before showing up with and Cibrian and Glanville’s two sons at the same Malibu restaurant last month.

“Stalking my boyfriend to show up with my kids was the last straw,” Glanville tweeted.

Now, Cibrian, 43, is telling his side of the story.

“Brandi was very drunk and after already being at our table, started to come back again. Her boyfriend ‘ran interference’ and came to ask if she could take photos with the kids,” Cibrian claims in an exclusive statement to Us Weekly. “After witnessing Brandi’s behavior at the restaurant I was concerned about what pictures Brandi might post. We looked at their socials after we got home to make sure there was nothing of concern. That’s exactly how it all went down.”

The Rosewood actor previously opened up about the situation on June 10. “I normally don’t respond to Brandi’s foolishness but I will not allow false and reverse accusations to go unanswered about my wife,” Cibrian told Us in a statement at the time. “LeAnn is a fantastic stepmom to the boys and is always gracious to their mother. Having to put up with Brandi’s made up drama all the time is extremely frustrating. After eight years we should have one priority, making sure two incredible kids are loved and remain happy and healthy. But every couple of months there is another accusation coming from Brandi in an attempt to drum up drama to stay relevant.”

He added: “LeAnn and I did not nor have we ever ‘shown up’ at places where Brandi will be. Why would we do that? Makes no sense. We had a reservation held at Nobu five days before Brandi posted she was going. Here is proof and if anyone needs more, call Nobu and they will confirm.”

Cibrian and the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star divorced in 2010 after nine years of marriage. As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, Cibrian and Rimes fell for each other while filming the 2009 Lifetime movie Northern Lights together.

The Brussels politicians said they want to stand against ‘sexist’ education by encouraging children to take an equal interest in all subjects ‘beyond gendered stereotypes’.

They hope that girls will take up scientific and technical subjects while boys could take up activities such as cleaning the home.

MEPs have revealed they want boys to learn about traditionally ‘female’ activities and should be taught domestic work and care at school

Textbooks showing old-fashioned stereotypes about male and female roles would also be thrown out of schools, under the European Parliament’ proposals.

The suggestions were made in the report on Empowering Girls Through Education from the Parliament’s FEMM Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with MEPs approving the proposals by 408 to 236.

The report says it 'encourages girls and boys in the education process to take an equal interest in all subjects, beyond gendered stereotypes, in particular as regards scientific and technical subjects, including boys’ learning about activities regarded as female, in areas such as domestic work and care’.

The Brussels politicians said they want to stand against ‘sexist’ education by encouraging children to take an equal interest in all subjects ‘beyond gendered stereotypes’

Another point says that schools should be guided ‘to embrace a gender perspective and gender equality, and to ensure the elimination of stereotypes and sexist distortions that textbooks and teaching materials may include in their content.'

It added: '[This will then] encourage them also to combat this sexism in literature, film, music, games, media, advertising and other areas that can contribute decisively to changing the attitudes, behaviour and identity of girls and boys’.

Portuguese socialist MEP Liliana Rodrigues, who spearheaded the proposals, said: ‘We are still living in an unequal Europe…women continue to be a prime target for discrimination and violence. I believe that school plays a fundamental role in changing this.

‘[We want to] create a school culture of gender equality, critically oversee the curricula and educational materials, ensure gender equality with regard to personal and professional decisions and improve the percentage of women in positions of responsibility.’

But Leading Labour Eurosceptic MP Kate Hoey told The Daily Express: ‘I have confidence in our nation’s ability to deal with educating our own children.

<|begin_of_text|>SOME women would prefer a world where men don’t exist. Just picture it. No hogging the remote. No beard clippings in the sink.

After all, it works for other species. Komodo dragons can reproduce without sex with a male partner. So can whiptail lizards, hammerhead sharks and parasitic wasps. And they seem happy enough.

But researchers say there’s a very important evolutionary reason men exist and without them a hypothetical asexual all-female human race would likely become extinct.

Professor Matt Gage from the University of East Anglia asked the question seven years ago: “Why should any species waste all that effort on sons?”

The answer, revealed this week, is more basic that you might think.

“We wanted to understand how Darwinian selection can allow this widespread and seemingly wasteful reproductive system to persist, when a system where all individuals produce offspring without sex — as in all-female asexual populations — would be a far more effective route to reproduce greater numbers of offspring.

His research, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, showed competition among males helped produce the healthiest offspring and the absence of sex could lead to mutation among offspring and eventual extinction.

“To be good at out-competing rivals and attracting partners in the struggle to reproduce, an individual has to be good at most things, so sexual selection provides an important and effective filter to maintain and improve population genetic health,” prof. Gage said.

“Our findings provide direct support for the idea that sex persists as a dominant mode of reproduction because it allows sexual selection to provide these important genetic benefits.

“In the absence of sex, populations accumulate deleterious mutations through a ratcheting effect where each new mutation takes a population closer to extinction.

What if there were fewer males? The researchers tested the theory that a more efficient form of reproduction would involve females giving birth to more females.

To find out if that might work, researchers took tribolium flour beetles and paired them with different numbers of males.

Over 10 years they paired 90 males with only 10 females. They then paired single males and females in monogamous pairings.

“Our monogamous treatment, for example, where there was no sexual selection for 50 generations, resulted in a lower level of population health and rapid extinction when populations were challenged by inbreeding. All the populations derived from monogamous histories became extinct after just eight generations,” prof. Gage said.

By contrast, populations where males had to compete for female attention maintained population health and avoided extinction

<|begin_of_text|>Nothing is like anything else. You can do nothing well or you can do nothing badly. Some people excel at nothing. Others have more difficulty with it. They grow restless, resent the loss of initiative and control, and, more deeply, they feel that “something” is inherently, even morally, superior to nothing.

The U.S. government national security apparatus, for better or for worse, sucks at nothing. In the policy process, the saying goes, something always beats nothing. As a bureaucratic fact, this is clearly true. But, from a policy perspective, is nothing always the wrong choice?

Currently, the Trump administration is engaged in something of a natural experiment on this question in eastern Syria. U.S. forces went to eastern Syria in 2014 to defeat ISIL. Now, with ISIL losing its last grip on territorial control in Syria, the foreign policy apparatus is reprising a time-honored tradition and asking itself what those forces should do next. The answer is unlikely to be nothing.

In what is surely a dizzying array of internal meeting and papers, the debate centers on how the United States should leverage its military presence in Syria, which the Pentagon recently acknowledged exceeds 2,000 troops, to pursue other objectives, namely countering Iran’s influence or post-conflict stabilization, or both. Entering into that debate, Faysal Itani has argued in this journal that a “small-time” U.S. mission in Syria would be unable to effectively counter Iran, pointing to the “imbalance of commitment and interests between the United States and Iran” and the overwhelming numerical advantage of pro-Iran forces. He notes that the United States would need a force of many “tens of thousands of combat troops” in Syria to challenge Iran or contribute to the country’s reconstruction process.

Consistent with U.S. government practice, Itani ignored the nothing option. He is certainly right about the limitations of the small U.S. force presently in Syria. But even a much larger force would stand a poor chance of rolling back — or even containing — Iranian influence in the war-ravaged country. The reason for this is the very “imbalance” on which Itani’s argument against a small force rests. Syria is simply not central to U.S. interests and, as such, Iran’s cost tolerance will far outpace that of the United States at almost any level of conceivable commitment.

Bashar al-Assad’s continued rule is obviously undesirable, not least for his wanton abuse of the Syrian people. Iran’s

Clashes erupted in Jerusalem at the al-Aqsa mosque, known as the third-holiest site in Islam.

Dozens gathered outside the mosque to protest Israel's ground invasion into Gaza, according to the International Business Times. Protesters then clashed with Israel Defense Forces after Friday prayers.

According to Israel Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld, following Friday prayers at the mosque compound, about 200 to 300 masked youths caused disturbances by throwing stones at policemen stationed nearby. After 20 minutes of disturbances, police entered the compound and arrested seven people for rioting.

"We had been notified in advance that this was planned," said Rosenfeld, adding that Israel had imposed an age limit on people who could enter the compound, which Jews refer to as the Temple Mount and which Muslims call Haram al-Sharif, or holy sanctuary. Only men over age 50 and women were allowed in to pray on Friday, but Rosenfeld said that younger men had spent the night at the compound in preparation for the riots on Friday.

According to reports, 100 Israelis stormed the courtyard and used rubber bullets to disperse crowds.

The Department for Transport has appointed two women to the civil service's first ever job share at director general level as successors to the DfT's newly appointed permanent secretary.

Polly Payne and Ruth Hannant will join the DfT as directors general for the department's Rail Group on 11 December from the Department for Education, filling the position left vacant when Bernadette Kelly was promoted to perm sec in April.

Kelly said the pair would be role models not only for the civil service but also for the rail sector, where women make up just 11% of the workforce and senior leaders are "overwhelmingly male".

She told Civil Service World: “I’m proud that the Department for Transport is leading the way with the first job share partnership at this level in government. And I’m especially pleased that we have Polly and Ruth joining us to lead our work on rail.

"We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation for over a century, so there’s a huge amount to do."

Kelly was DG for Rail Group from September 2015 to April 2017, when Nick Joyce took the post in an "acting" capacity.

Rail Group is responsible for developing strategy and policy for the rail sector, managing expenditure on rail services and infrastructure, and oversees the delivery of rail franchises and major projects – including Crossrail and Thameslink.

It sponsors British Transport Police, Network Rail, the Office of Rail and Road, the Rail Accidents Investigation Branch and Transport Focus.

Payne and Hannant were already in a job-share partnership with each other working on higher education reform in DfE, and have both previously worked for the former Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and theTreasury. Former BIS permanent secretary Martin Donnelly described the pair as an "outstandingly effective job share", during an interview with Civil Service World earlier this year.

DfT said the appointment demonstrated the government's commitment to increasing the number of women working in the rail sector. The Transport Infrastructure Skills Strategy, published in 2015, included an aim for women to make up 20% of DfT's science and technical apprenticeships by 2020, and 50% by 2030.

Kelly added: “Within the DfT we are making progress in encouraging diversity at every level, and earlier this year the department was recognised for our leadership on workplace gender equality by

Rather than engaging in expensive and often drawn out lawsuits, a majority of Android vendors have signed licensing agreements with patent holders. Microsoft has already signed licensing agreements with more than 20 Android manufacturers, including big-name players such as HTC, Samsung and LG. The company claims that 80% of Android smartphones sold in the U.S. and most devices sold throughout the world are now covered under its various agreements.

Geoff Duncan at DigitalTrends estimates that if Microsoft averaged a royalty of $1 per each Android device, it could generate roughly $430 million in revenue this year. Microsoft is estimated to collect somewhere near $8 per device, however, meaning its royalty fees could total $3.4 billion in 2013.

As Android device shipments increase, so will Microsoft’s revenue. If half of the 1.5 billion Android devices that are estimated to ship worldwide in 2017 resulted in a royalty fee paid to Microsoft, the company could earn $5.9 billion dollars. Microsoft claims to earn royalties from a “majority” of Android vendors worldwide, though. Based on that information, if the company were to collect royalties from 75% of Android vendors in 2017, it could pull in an estimated $8.8 billion in additional revenue.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>

<|begin_of_text|>Fox News viewers really do see the world differently.

New data shows that Fox loyalists, when compared to the public at large, are far more pessimistic about America's future; are far more critical of President Obama's performance; are far more fearful of Hillary Clinton; and are more forgiving of Donald Trump.

The sharp differences in opinion extend to beliefs about political corruption, voter fraud and media coordination with campaigns. Fox fans, when compared to fans of other networks, are far more likely to express concern about November's election results being manipulated.

They are also more likely to agree with the sentiment that divisions in the United States are deeper than in the past.

The data -- from a new national poll by Suffolk University -- shows deep divisions, indeed. And it demonstrates why 21st Century Fox patriarch Rupert Murdoch recently told the Wall Street Journal that it would be "business suicide" to change Fox's editorial direction.

Overall, the poll finds that the country is split about Clinton, with 46% of all respondents having a favorable view of her versus 47% unfavorable. Among people who rate Fox News as their most-trusted source of news, however, sentiments are much more solidly anti-Clinton, with 84% viewing her unfavorably, versus just 13% favorably.

Similarly, 54% of all Suffolk respondents approve of President Obama's job performance, versus 41% who disapprove. But among Fox loyalists, the numbers are radically different, with 16% approving of the president's performance and 80% disapproving.

During the Obama presidency Fox News positioned itself as a voice of the opposition. Fox's most popular shows, like "The O'Reilly Factor," reinforced these sentiments.

If Clinton is elected president, Fox's audience will expect more of the same.

Fox News says it reaches many independents and some Democrats. But several surveys, including Suffolk's, shows that Fox's base is passionately pro-Republican, aligning with GOP positions and GOP candidates.

Suffolk's polls ask many of the same questions that other pollsters ask during presidential election years -- but add a layer of questions about media consumption on top.

The Suffolk pollsters ask: "What TV news or commentary source do you trust the most?"

In the most recent poll, 270 of the 1,000 respondents said Fox -- the single highest result of any of the networks named in the poll. This reflects Fox's tight grip on conservatives. More than

President Obama blames global warming for his daughter's asthma. Today that's politically useful spin, but the science says something different. If you're looking for a culprit, it just might be Malia's dad.

In an interview Wednesday, in support of a new White House climate change awareness campaign, the president noted that his 16-year-old daughter had asthma when she was 4. He said that as a father, when your child says she has trouble breathing, "the fright you feel is terrible." Fortunately, doctors were able to treat Malia's condition quickly.

The president connected his daughter's malady to global climate change. In a discussion Tuesday, he said "all of our families are going to be vulnerable" to global warming-induced health risks because "you can't cordon yourself off from air or from climate."

A White House fact sheet connected the dots, saying that asthma rates have more than doubled in the past 30 years, and that "climate change is putting these individuals and many other vulnerable populations at greater risk of landing in the hospital" like Malia.

The good news is that there is less reason for alarm than the White House suggests. The Environmental Protection Agency cautions that "outdoor air pollution and pollen may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma." Yet the EPA also reports that our air quality has substantially improved; aggregate emissions of common pollutants have decreased 62% between 1980 and 2013. It is unlikely that cleaner air is causing the increase in asthma.

Whether there is a link between asthma and global warming, Malia herself hasn't really experienced much. The high school junior was born in 1998, when temperatures spiked. By some measurements, the world hasn't warmed significantly since then.

Which brings us back to her father and his Marlboros. The president, who quit smoking years ago, has long kept his tobacco use out of doors. That's a common-sense tactic for folks who have trouble quitting. But sometimes, science can show that common sense has less sense than you think.

Research funded by the National Institutes of Health has shown that smoking outside doesn't totally protect children from secondhand smoke. Even when smoking is done outside, nicotine in infants' hair is five times higher for babies with outside smoking parents than non-smoking parents. Smoking-related chemicals in infants' urine is seven times

<|begin_of_text|>Shoot lasers at the moon, solve Earth’s energy crisis. Boom. Done. Next global problem please, we’re on a roll. This is the statement I wish Japan’s Shimizu Corp. had released about their new energy plan, but alas they’ve simply just announced the details of a scheme to harvest solar power from panels on the moon. But, what a plan it is.

Robots will build a belt of solar panels to encircle the moon. The panels will gather up energy from the sun, convert it to electricity and then channel the electricity by cable around to the Earth-facing side of the moon. From there the power will be zapped to large receivers on Earth’s surface using lasers. Why did it take so long for someone to propose this?

The Luna Ring plan, which was introduced in Tokyo, is only the most recent in a long line of envelope pushing, seemingly kooky ideas to come from Shimizu Corp. But, the company seems serious about their plan proposing that the Luna Ring could begin construction by the year 2035.

Judging from the amount of technology needed (a working robot colony on the moon?) and the financial drain attempting such a project would entail, we won’t be holding our breath for this one. Although, because the moon already drives ocean tides the idea of finding even more uses for the moon isn’t completely crazy. Shimizu’s plan might seem like something straight out of a comedy routine, but its not like they’re trying to blow up the moon or anything. Right?

<|begin_of_text|>Public officials and the relatively financially secure have long been guilty of turning the homeless and the poor into scapegoats — and making examples of the people perhaps in most need of compassion and help from their neighbors. It happens everywhere in America. And it's also become all too common in most Western countries around the world.

Just last week in Florida, the Ft. Lauderdale City Commission made it a crime for anyone to sleep publicly downtown, or for panhandlers to approach cars at "busy intersections." According to the Sun Sentinel, the infractions are punishable by $500 and 60 days in jail. That's money and time many people just can't afford to spare.

And earlier this year in London, one luxury apartment building installed so-called "anti-homeless spikes" near entranceways to keep the homeless from sleeping in those spaces.

This is no way to treat people who are less fortunate. But more than that, it betrays a serious lack of empathy toward those who might be in need of shelter.

More than 600,000 people in America are homeless. Ignorance and the perpetuation of a number of stereotypes has led to the creation of rigid categories of the haves and have nots. But it doesn't have to be that way. Much can be done to help ensure virtually no American has to forage for food or search/create their own shelter. Everyone can start by consciously challenging the deeply ingrained myths and questions people think about the homeless.

1. Why can't you get a job like everyone else?

For a job interview at a bank or even a burger joint, candidates need clean clothes, shoes in good condition, a shower and hygienic products so that they can appear as their best selves. Resumes, transportation and a stable telephone number are also needed.

Even if they have marketable skills, most homeless and poor people are just trying to survive at the most basic level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a time-consuming search for food, water and shelter.

And in an environment where jobs requiring relatively low amounts of skill aren't paid living wages — especially within the retail and fast-food industries — even homeless people who are able to secure an interview are likely to end up part of the "working poor," as chronicled by Barbara Ehrenreich in Nickled and Dimed.

Tannen Campbell filed in a Florida court [PDF] this week accusing the virtual-reality startup of maintaining a "hostile environment" and a "macho bullying atmosphere." She claimed she was fired after she challenged CEO Rony Abovitz on the "depths of misogyny in Magic Leap's culture."

As VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, Campbell says part of her job was to help the tech company with what it called its "pink/blue problem" (quick hint: not calling gender inequality a "pink/blue problem" is probably a good first step).

The pinkness was also literally an issue: the all-male tech team (who were matched by the all-male advertising and executive teams) were asked to consider how to make their augmented reality headset more female friendly and, according to Campbell, the only solution they arrived at was to produce a version in pink.

The lawsuit then offers a wide range of accusations of sexism, stemming from tetchy to highly personal to jaw-dropping. For starters, she took issue with the fact that the Florida company's jobs page was titled "Wizards wanted," seemingly shutting out women.

She then goes on to slam the CFO for being "the kind of man who sits a little too close to women," and the VP of IT for being loud and making "misogynistic comments." She even turns on the company's most senior woman, its chief business officer, accusing her of being "the perfect Magic Leap female employee: she went to Harvard, never disagrees with Abovitz and always does Abovitz's bidding."

Presentation

Before you start writing off Campbell, however, she goes into some depth on the practices and approaches she recommended Magic Leap adopt in order to bring about a more balanced workplace, and they are good. Although some are perhaps more of a wish list – such as paying for a recruiter to help the partners of female hires relocated to Florida to find jobs as well to help ease the move to the company, and paying for female tech leaders including Sheryl Sandberg and Meg Whitman to attend company meetings as speakers.

She developed a presentation for CEO Abovitz but her scheduled meeting to go over it was cancelled no fewer than six times. It took her eight months to get the meeting, and then he terminated the meeting about halfway through. Efforts

<|begin_of_text|>Women in headscarves and men in tatty clothes puff on a glass pipe as smoke swirls around their faces. The pictures published by Iranian media and blogs in recent months are a sign of a new drug epidemic: shishe, or methamphetamine.

Shishe means “glass” in Farsi, a reference to the appearance of the drug in some of its purest forms.

In less than a decade, methamphetamine use has skyrocketed in Iran to the point where now about 345,000 Iranians are considered addicts, according to official statistics.

Seizures of methamphetamine soared 128 percent between 2008 and 2012, topping all other countries in the region, according to figures compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year alone, the government of Iran confiscated 3.6 tons of shishe.

A top official from the Iran Drug Control Headquarters said last year that shishe could be found in Tehran in “less than five minutes,” according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency.

Shishe addicts in Iran are mostly urban, middle class and young, experts say. Notably, there are a large number of women who abuse shishe, too.

One of the main reasons why shishe use has spread quickly in Iran is a lack of information about the drug, which has led casual users to believe, erroneously, that it is not addictive, experts say.

Struggling university students have begun abusing it to stay up longer and try to boost their performance in school. Women have been sold the drug in beauty salons with the promise that it will help them lose weight, according to local media reports.

“We really had a hard time convincing people that this is addiction,” said Azaraksh Mokri, a psychiatrist who teaches at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences and has dealt extensively with the issue of shishe addiction.

Opium addiction has long been a problem in Iran partly because of a tolerance for its use even in conservative rural areas, and also because of the country’s long border with Afghanistan, for decades one of the top opium producers. Opium is still the most abused drug in Iran, according to official statistics.

Shishe began to make inroads in the country about a decade ago, luring users who preferred its effects as a stimulant to the more soporific opium, which was seen as a drug of the poor and elderly.

That shift has been characterized as a change between drugs which are known as sonati, or

One of the standout episodes of Room 104, the new Duplass-helmed HBO series, makes great use of this phenomenon. Titled “The Internet,” it’s set in 1997. Our only visible character, a harried, wannabe novelist, is locked for nearly the full half-hour in a phone call with his mom. Anish needs his manuscript sent to him, in a bad way. He’s got a life-changing meeting with an agent coming up, a book to finish, and of course, he forgot his laptop. Actor Karan Soni paces the dinky motel room for which the series is named in a sweat, walking his oblivious mom through the mechanics of email with a growing frustration in his voice that betrays just how deep their relationship is.

Featuring only Soni and Poorna Jagannathan as his mother, the scene manages to do a lot with a little. From nearly her first line, Jagannathan establishes her character as one we haven’t seen rendered so well before: the loving but passive-aggressive, alternately icy, and helicoptering desi mom. Jagannathan’s character seems almost at times to be trolling Anish, so hypnotically layered is her cadence. To pull it off, Jagannathan told Vulture by email, she channeled her own, super-sweet mom, as well as her split attitude toward her 11-year-old son. When he talks, “There’s a part of you that is in wonder and amazement and so much love, and then there’s a part that’s totally bored and needs to just reach for the wine.”

Both actors were born in India — Soni in New Delhi to a middle-class family, while Jagannathan is the daughter of a diplomat. Her accent gives away the upper-crust, Brit-lite India that she belongs to, though her character’s origins are notably humble. But that inconsistency doesn’t detract from her possession of the role. The Duplasses are known for encouraging improvisation, and she sprinkles her rejoinders with “beta” and “raja” — the latter, meaning prince, less known than the former, which means son. The episode — not written with Indians in mind — wasn’t meant to be a model of representational politics at work. Soni took the part a day before shooting, after the

<|begin_of_text|>Cultural criticism is taboo. In polite company, all cultures are created equally. None is better or worse than any other; they’re just different. We aren’t responsible for the culture we were born into, so there’s no objective basis for criticism or judgement.

In progressive ideology, this idea goes a step further. Not only must we respect all cultural differences, we mustn’t stray outside the norms of the culture we were born into. A white woman with dreadlocks, for example, should respect black culture and shave her hair off, rather than “steal” a hairstyle from a different culture. They even have a special word for this grievance: cultural appropriation.

I think cultural appropriation is a load of baloney, based on the most persistent errors in political/social thought: abstraction errors – misunderstanding the relationship between people and labels, between aggregates and concretes. These errors are not only imprecise, but they are counter-productive, divisive, and downright dangerous.

Equal Equivocation

The first abstraction error goes like this, “All differences between people are benign differences. Some people are born with light hair; others with dark hair. Neither is superior to the other. In the same way, all cultural differences are benign. Some cultures value monogamy; others are more sexually liberal. Neither is superior to the other.”

This concept is applied across the board. Some cultures are more religious; some value education more highly; some are more hierarchical, etc. These differences should not be judged, any more than we should judge somebody for their height or the amount of freckles on their face.

Then, the story goes, because all cultures are essentially equal, any differences in the socio-economic status of ethnic groups must be a function of discrimination. Without racism or discrimination, all cultures would be equally represented across the socio-economic spectrum.

In reality, we’ve no reason to believe this is true. Nowhere in the world – nowhere in history – are all cultures represented equally across the socio-economic spectrum. The idea is an appealing, aesthetic one, no doubt, but it’s not grounded in the real world.

Different cultures value different things; some skills are valued more highly than others; throughout the world, Chinese immigrants tend to have the highest average income of any demographic. Why is this? It’s not because they are genetically superior; it’s not because of pro-Chinese discrimination (in fact, it’s largely despite negative discrimination); it’s because Chinese culture heavily emphasizes academic performance in the hard sciences, and the hard

Just as 3D TVs and monitors had a tough enough time getting our attention, 4K is still hobbled by a severe lack of content in its 3840×2160 resolution. TV buyers may lose interest once they burn through the limited films and series available on smart sets' download and streaming services. Computer users, however, have had more reasons to tiptoe toward the quadrupling of 1080p—at the very least, to enjoy super-crisp text and details in their regular work and browsing.

Displays as dense as 2880×1800 and 3200×1800 have already landed in our laps, but Toshiba has come out as the first legitimate 4K laptop producer.

How can you say you support the Occupy movement while you stay in Capital One Bank’s commercials? That’s like saying you support the Occupy movement and getting caught having sex with Mitt Romney. Baldwin went as far as to wax poetic on the Huffington Post about the Occupy movement and a DOCUMENTARY HE SAW that was about unemployed people in Long Island. He highly recommends it. Baldwin also called out the “excessive fees forced on customers by certain banks” (“come to Capital One, we’d never do that! We’re totally not one of the least-trusted banks in America.“) and pointed out that Occupy Wall Street “talks a lot, too much in fact, about One Percent versus Ninety Nine Percent.” That’s why we need you Alec, to show us into the light of Capital One bank.

Even though the crack game got him started in the rap game, Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) has been living in the mogul world for quite some time. The man openly brags about having watches he hasn’t seen in months and an apartment at the Trump he only slept in once. So when he put out T-shirts through his Rocawear clothing line which read “Occupy All Streets”, the streets took offense. Especially when it was revealed that none of the proceeds from the shirts would go to the Occupy movement. Young Hov!

“Kanye West does not care about poor people,” – every person on earth.

Kanye West is already pretty well liked in America, but his charitable ways know no bounds. Following in “Big Brother” Jay-Z’s footsteps, Kanye West also decided to show his support for the Occupy movement by showing up once for a few minutes. Reports from the protest described Kanye as uncharacteristically “demure” despite the authentic gold chains he wore, in an unintentionally hilarious show of support.

<|begin_of_text|>Why are so few novelists from working class backgrounds? And why does it matter who gets to write novels and get them published? Author Kit de Waal investigates.

"The more we reinforce the stereotypes of who writes and who reads, the more the notion of exclusivity is reinforced. It takes balls to gatecrash a party."

Kit de Waal, published her first novel, My Name is Leon, in 2016 at the age of 55. She has already put her money where her mouth is - using part of the advance she received from Penguin to set up a creative writing scholarship in an attempt to improve working class representation in the arts.

Kit knows that - as a writer from a working class background - the success of her debut novel is a rare occurrence. Born to a Caribbean bus driver father and an Irish mother (a cleaner, foster carer and auxiliary nurse), Kit grew up in Birmingham and left school at 15 with no qualifications. She became a secretary with the Crown Prosecution Service and went on to have a career in social services and criminal law.

In this feature she explores an issue that is deeply personal to her. She looks back at her own life and trajectory, and takes the listener on a journey around the country to find out what the barriers really are to working class representation in British literature today.

"There is a difference between working class stories and working class writers. Real equality is when working class writers can write about anything they like - an alien invasion, a nineteenth century courtesan, a medieval war. All we need is the space, the time to do it - oh yes, and some way to pay the bills!"

Kit talks to a range of writers, agents and publishers about what the barriers are for writers from working class backgrounds, including Tim Lott, Andrew McMillan, Gena-mour Barrett, CEO of Penguin Random House UK Tom Weldon, Julia Bell, Julia Kingsford, Ben Gwalchmai, Nathan Connolly and Stephen Morrison-Burke (Birmingham poet laureate and the first recipient of the Kit de Waal scholarship).

An athlete and a transgender person – that both identities could be conceivable fascinates our media landscape, from the New York Post all the way up to the New York Times. This is perhaps why speculation about Bruce Jenner’s gender identity has been disappointingly rife in recent weeks, even though the athlete has not spoken out about it.

Fallon Fox knows what it’s like to be the focus of rumours and hearsay. She is a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter – and the first openly trans athlete in the sport’s history.

Fox is intimately familiar with our culture’s treatment of trans athletes. She was not out publicly when she began competing, although licensing commissions knew she was trans. But after Fox began winning, a reporter called her and made it clear he knew she was trans. Fox understood she had to get ahead of the story, so she came out in an Outsports article in March 2013.

When I ask Fox about the obsessive interest in an athlete’s transition, she brings up the retrogressive idea that, despite the fact that there are actually many female athletes, sports are men’s domain. This leads people to see Jenner’s athletic abilities as a sign of maleness, making the possibility that Jenner might be trans a contradiction to gawk at.

I ask Fox about being put in the position of having to come out publicly so early in her career. “That sucked. I expected that someone was going to out me; you just can’t go through life with a microscope on your career without someone delving into your past a little bit,” she says. “But it’s something you really can’t prepare yourself for.” Her face grows serious. “The scope of anger and vitriol that I received initially... That was disheartening, tragic. It was mind-blowing.”

This is not how Fox wanted her career to go. Her dream narrative would have been for her to go in there just like any other fighter would, collecting wins, hopefully ending up the best female fighter on the face of the planet. “I suppose I’d like all of that still,” she says pensively. “But in addition to that, I want to bring my people with me.”

Whenever I buy a book, I have this (good?) habit of writing my name and the date on the flyleaf. In the case of The Handmaid’s Tale, the fading scrawl on the yellowing pages in my copy tells me I bought it in February, 2003, and I clearly remember reading it with due alacrity, for I was told by people more well-read and aware than I that it was a must-read, science fiction or otherwise. A dystopian classic that’s spoken of in the same breath as Orwell’s 1984, Huxley’s Brave New World and Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, but with a predominant feminist theme.

And I was hooked from the first page, and horrified as that bleak and terrifying world revealed itself, page by page.

A world where women are denied their humanity, and their bodies are merely vessels for reproduction. Consent doesn’t come into the picture. A world where selective reading of holy books guides the government, and patriarchy is at the root of all laws.

And that’s just the beginning. It’s a truly harrowing world that Atwood has created.

I finished the book but it stayed with me, at least in its broad contours, as the years rolled by. Events took place in our world that kept taking me back to the world of The Handmaid’s Tale. The rise of the Taliban and their restrictions on women. Global warming, rapid climate change and toxic pollution. The Fukushima nuclear disaster. The death of Savita Halappanavar in the Republic of Ireland because she was denied an abortion under Catholic laws. The rise and rise of Islamophobia. The weaponisation of religion and misogyny. The fight for equal rights for women and marches for women’s rights. And more recently, the meteoric rise of conservatism in the West and Americans talking about fleeing to Canada.

That’s why, for a book written in 1985, The Handmaid’s Tale feels eerily contemporary; nay, all too real and very ‘today’ (with my memory refreshed by a re-read this week). Perhaps not surprising when you come to know that while writing the book, Atwood made it a rule for herself to only include events that have happened in history and could — very plausibly — happen overnight within the ambit of existing laws and social mores, and for which the technology did not already exist.

<|begin_of_text|>Women who seek leadership roles in business often face the prospect, whether real or perceived, of having to choose between nurturing their careers or building a robust family and personal life. The publication in March of Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, inspired a renewed debate about feminism. It suggested in a strong, if controversial, fashion that women can have it all.

The confidence and authority that are required of leaders play a role in making choices about how to integrate work and other aspects of life, participants said at a panel titled, “How to be the Champion of Your Own Career,” at the recent Wharton Women in Business conference. Moderated by Arnold J. Rosoff, an emeritus professor of legal studies and business ethics at Wharton, the five-person panel was one of the conference’s first ever to include both men and women.

Early in the discussion, J.J. Cutler, executive vice president of Aramark, invoked the title of the panel and sought to broaden the subject. “I would be very thoughtful about how you define ‘career,’” he said. “Instead of thinking about being a champion of a career, I’d think about just being a champion of your life. In particular, I would be very thoughtful — and it will change over time — about what role you want work and career to play in your overall life.

“Be really flexible,” Cutler added. “Your life is likely going to get messier and more complicated, and the world is going to get more complicated from here on out.… Creating a vision for yourself is great, but I would be careful about [making] too many hard and fast rules and plans.”

Creating a vision for yourself is great, but I would be careful about [making] too many hard and fast rules and plans.”— J.J. Cutler

Picking the right partner, Cutler said, is “super important.” He noted that Sandberg may have raised fewer eyebrows than a man would have in choosing to discuss the role of a romantic partner in a businesswoman’s career. “The people I’ve observed who are happy, successful [and] fulfilled, oftentimes … [have someone] outside of work who, when good stuff happens, the good stuff is a lot better, and when bad stuff happens, you’ve got someone there who can help you deal with it,” he stated. “And there will be both.
